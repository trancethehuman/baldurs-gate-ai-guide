At the beginning of Shattered Sanctum, you will first speak to Liam after freeing him from his torturer. (See Goblin Camp on how to successfully infiltrate Shattered Sanctum peacefully). Your next interaction is to speak with Gribbo, the one in charge of Volo, the Bard that was seen performing upon entering the Goblin Camp. You will have a conversation with Gribbo here to attempt to set Volo free by any means.

If you attempt the Deception check, you will have to pass a DC of 10. Once you have convinced her, she'll hand you the cage key and you can now speak to Volo freely. Volo will then ask to unlock his cage so he can escape. You find out that he is inside the camp to jumpstart his career, but found it to be a failure. You can now look around the room and find the letter addressed to 'Dearest Elminister' on the table. Make sure to lock the door before you attempt to free Volo here. You'll engage in another conversation with Volo and you can invite him to camp as he suggests the use of an invisibility potion to escape the Goblins. You can either agree to accept Volo or not.

After freeing Volo, continue to explore the Shattered Sanctum and you will find Bloodied Shrine at (X:330 Y:-20) You will find Abdirak waiting outside a door, and with a Religion proficiency, additional information reveals that this man is a follower of Loviatar, goddess of pain. He reveals that he will be teaching the goblins how to inflict pain with a purpose. This same man recognizes the pain that your character is feeling and offers to alleviate the pain through the teachings of Loviatar. He claims that his work will grant peace and serenity. Lae'zel chimes in and states her interest to see what his 'skilled hand' can do. No DC checks here but your answer will have a bearing on the approval of Astarion and Shadowheart. You can decide for yourself if you want to proceed with the ritual.

As Abdirak hits you, Shadowheart and Astarion engage in quick exchanges as if savoring your suffering. Attempting the Performance check (Charisma) will require you to pass a DC of 10 for this section.

Abdirak proceeds with hitting you and he finally acknowledges you that he has served your penance. If you state that you have found the ritual to be interesting, he tells you that Loviatar would like to bless you. You will get Acolyte: A Kiss Without Mercy, an event that inspires Shadowheart. When the ritual is done, you can grab the Ritual Dagger and Ritual Axe on the table if you wish to do so. After the ritual, you will also get the condition: Loviatar's Love. You can leave this area or you can loot a Necrotic Mace from him if you kill him.

On to your next encounter, explore further the Shattered Sanctum at (X: 270 Y:13) you will find Brakkal, a follower of Maglubiyet, who, with your Religion proficiency, is recognized as a tyrannical deity who treats his followers as slaves. In a nearby area, you can interact with a Rat to get further information on the area by using Speak with Animals, or a relevant potion.

In the next area, still at Shattered Sanctum at (X:290 Y:34), you will find one of the leaders Dror Ragzlin performing a ritual on one of the corpses in front of his followers. Here, you can approach the corpse and get real close with it. As you study the corpse, Dror Ragzlin will claim that this creature had a weapon and they're looking for the killer, and thus, the weapon. He invites you to settle in. As a Dragonborn, the character here feels the anxiety of Shadowheart, who carries the weapon that they are looking for. 

After persuading Dror Ragzlin, he acknowledges that you're a True Soul and commands you to seek Minthara and join her on the attack on the grove. Agreeing here will get Shadowheart's approval. This event will also inspire Astarion 'Charalatan: Devil's Advocate.' As your party walks to the next destination, you will see a Scrying Eye, and Astarion points out not to do anything suspicious while it's watching. Inside Shattered Sanctum (X:333 Y:42), you will find Nightwarden Minthara holding a meeting with other goblins.

She recognizes you as a True Soul, and asks if you will be joining her hunt. Remember that Dror Ragzlin asked you to join her hunt but you can still decide here if you want to go on your own hunt. Here you can tell her that you are looking for Halsin, a druid, who is the same Druid that they're after. You are given a choice before she senses that you have been to the grove. You can confront Minthara here as she is left with very few goblins in this area.  If the Scrying Eye spots you in this area, make sure to destroy it too. Pick up the valuable items you can get from Minthara such as the Mind Flayer Parasite Specimen.

Continue exploring Shattered Sanctum to find the Roah Moonglow, a halfling at (X:274 Y:-29). An NPC who sells items within the sanctum. If she recognizes you as a friend of the family, then she will offer a discount, albeit, a small one.

Your next meeting here will happen at (X:296 Y:-25), where you will find True Soul Gut in the middle of a platform. She claims that she will brand you as well, just as The Absolute has done. She claims that it is protection and is embedded in magic. You can dive deeper into her mind here but be aware that she can also do the same to yours, allowing both of you to get further information about each other.

She claims that she can help you with anything and invites you into her chapel, away from the others. Note that agreeing to receive help from True Soul Gut will warrant the approval down of Astarion. Before the ritual begins, she asks the others to leave and then the interaction begins. You can choose if you will attack her here, fight the intrusion, or let her in your mind. Fight off her intrusion, and repel her attempts successfully to complete the quest. She claims now that she can't help you and ask The Absolute for help immediately, you can begin attacking her while she is away from the others. Retrieve the Rancid Note, Mind Flayer Parasite Specimen, and Priestess' Key from her belongings.

Your next destination is the Worg Pens (X:393 Y:-60) where you will find a caged bear that is being hurt by Brawler Birka. The bear asks for your help and you can decide to interfere with them and offer your assistance to the bear. Agreeing here will cause the bear to attack the gate and the battle begins. Your goal here is to not let any of the witnesses escape as you help the bear. After winning the battle, the bear transforms into Halsin, the Druid that you were looking for.

Seek his help to remove the parasite and he acknowledges that you are different from the others, and not bowing down to the powers of the True Absolute. He informs you of what he knows about the parasites and is aware that someone is using powerful magic to modify the tadpoles, he then explains that he can't cure you, but still offers to help. He tells you that these powers come from Moonrise Towers and that it's possible to find a cure there.

He claims that killing the three leaders will restore order. He asks for your help and offers to help you out after he is secure the safety of his grove. After this conversation, you will find a locked Grated Iron Doors at (X:410 Y:-32) and have Astarion unlock it for you. You will find a corpse of an elf on the wall. Attempting the Investigation check here will require a DC score of 5. Pulling out the body reveals a tunnel that can possibly lead to another area.

Continuing your journey in the Shatteref Sanctum, you will return to the mysterious hole that you found. When interacting with this, you find out that it is still blocked so you will attempt to clear this out. For now, you will return to Dror Ragzlin's throne where you first encountered him. This time, there are no rituals but he is seated on his throne. For a better chance of surviving this battle, you will want to take out the Narvass, the Novice of the Absolute who is alone above the throne behind Dror Ragzlin. 

An enemy will detect this, however, but you will have an advantage now that you were able to take out one of them. Be careful not to get anyone killed in your party, but if you end up having one of your allies dying, you can use Scroll of Revivify on them. When the battle is over, go to Dror Ragzlin's body and recover his key and the Mind Flayer Parasite Specimen. Your thoughts get interrupted as the dream visitor speaks to you in your mind. It commands you to absorb its potential which can enhance you. Rejecting the tadpole here will not gather any approval or approval down from the current party. 

However, if you decline, Astarion offers to at least let one of the party members try it than just let it sit in your pack. This will update your journal under Personal Quest if you prefer to Embrace your Potential by harvesting the parasite's memories. With the key that you recovered from Dror Ragzlin, you can unlock the Iron Gate right on the balcony behind his throne to get valuable items such as Amulet of Selune's Chosen, Infernal Iron, Springstep Boots, and other items.

Proceed to the locked Heavy Oak Doors at (X:310 Y:-25). Be careful as opening this door will launch enemies into attacking you and your party. This will be a long battle and you must be well prepared for it. After winning this, you should by now, have killed all of the leaders of the goblins. This is an event that will inspire Lae'zel.

Next, return to Halsin who has asked for your help in defeating the goblins to restore order and protect his grove. You will find him at (X394 Y:-31)., inform him that you have slain all three of the leaders. Now you can invite Halsin to join your party and help you on your quest to get to Moonrise Towers. After this area, return to Druid Grove by using the Waypoints that you have unlocked. The closest will be Emerald Grove Environs and you begin traveling from there to continue your quest with Halsin.
