# RETURN TO THE SURFACE, LOWER CITY

As soon as you're done with getting intel, you can return to the surface and complete the quest in Water Queen's House. If you offered to help the Wave Servant, which meant that you would fight Redhammer the Deviser, then make use of the Waypoint in the docks, then walk to the Water Queen's House to complete the Avenge The Drowned. Make your way to the back of the building where the Waveservants are gathered. They will ask you if it's done, and if you killed Redhammer, then you tell them that the beastmaster is dead.

Flood Tide Allandra Grey will thank you for your service and she will reward you with the Wavemother's Robe, a very rare clothing that provides Watery Rejuvenation and Temperature adjustment. Make sure to check out the Armour page for more info.
