NOTE: There are 2 versions of this walkthrough that will affect the outcome of your relationship with one of the companions. We recommend following the version indicated here, but you may view the alternate version in the Moonrise Towers guide. The first guide will feature infiltrating the Moonrise Towers and playing along as a faithful warrior to The Absolute, only to betray them once you discover that Nightsong is the relic that Ketheric Thorm was referring to. Shadowheart will abandon her duty to Lady Shar by freeing the Nightsong, instead of killing her.
