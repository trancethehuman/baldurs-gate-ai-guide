Before making your way inside Emerald Grove, you first need to go here (X:216 Y:411) to initiate a cutscene. The cutscene will show Aradin, alongside his companions Remira and Barth, arguing with Kanon to open the gate leading to Emerald Grove. Kanon does not budge as he says the gates must be kept shut as per Zevlor's orders. Aradin then tells Zevlor that they were fighting off a group of Goblins and now followed them there, Zevlor then orders Kanon to raise the gate, but it's too late. The group of goblins arrives and just as Kanon was raising the gate, he gets struck by multiple arrows. Although it may seem they are being overwhelmed, Wyll shows up at the scene to help. After that, you will immediately engage in combat. During this combat encounter, take advantage of your positioning as you are already at a high ground. Once you've slain all the enemies in the area, Zevlor will then order someone to open the gate. Before going through the gate, you can loot the corpses of fallen enemies for useful items. You can loot the Brass Locket out of Barth's corpse if he dies during the encounter. Now go through the gate, and you'll reach Emerald Grove (X:209 Y:454). As you move forward, you'll see Aradin and Zevlor arguing about what just happened. After your conversation with them, make your way up a hill (X:248 Y:444) and you'll encounter a Bugbear Assassin trying to kill off Nadira. Make quick work of him, loot some items off his corpse, then interact with Nadira. She says you have good timing as she would not have won that encounter. But she thinks you're not actually there to save her, and instead thinks you're after her Soul Coin. You'll have a few dialogue options that can lead you to acquire the Soul Coin.

Now head north to find Zevlor (X:206 Y:477) and interact with him. He thanks you for your assistance earlier during the goblin attack, then he starts introducing himself. He then warns you that visitors are no longer welcome in Emerald Grove and whatever your business is with this place, he wants to see to it quickly, since the druids are forcing everyone out and this attack will only strengthen their resolve. He also asks if you could persuade Kagha, even if it's not your business. He thinks you can persuade her since she owes you for saving this place. If tell him you'll talk to speak to Kagha, you will receive a disapproval from Astarion. Zevlor then says he owes you a great debt and asks that you talk some sense into the druids, before more lives are lost.

Make your way inside The Hollow (X:206 Y:496). There's a merchant named Arron located at (X:204 Y:512). You can interact with him to see his inventory, you can also engage in a conversation if you wish to do so. As you move forward, you'll notice a Haystack (X:214 Y:535), you need to pass a Perception check to interact with it and loot whatever item you find inside it.

Just up ahead at (X:212 Y:544), you'll see a couple of Tieflings, as well as Wyll training a young tiefling named Umi. Once your minds connect with each other, Wyll will reveal that the woman in her thoughts is named Karlach, an archdevil's soldier he swore on his good eye to kill. He said he tracked her down through the Hells to the mind flayer ship. But he was infected before he could kill her. He's worried about her being out in the open, preying on the innocent, and if he doesn't deal with her as soon as possible, she'll be leaving a trail of corpses. Lae'zel will also disapprove if you ask Wyll to join your party.

Now head north and you'll find Zorru (X:205 Y:568). Interacting with him will gain you Lae'zel's approval. He starts off being scared of Lae'zel, if you choose the DRAGONBORN option and give the Zorru a menacing stare, you'll gain the approval of Astarion, Lae'zel, and Shadowheart. You will gain another approval from Lae'zel if you let her make Zorru lower his head even further. After interrogating Zorru, an exclamation mark will then be seen on top of Lae'zel, interact with her to start a conversation. If tell Lae'zel she's being rough, you will gain Shadowheart's approval, but gain Lae'zel and Astarion's disapproval in the process.

Now move forward and you'll see a shabby door leading to the Makeshift Prison area (X:188 Y:592). As you go through the door, you'll see a goblin named Sazza imprisoned in a cage, and a tiefling named Arka aiming her crossbow at her. She thinks this goblin killed her brother, Kanon. Memnos then tries to stop her but she refuses to listen, so he just walks away. Sazza still continues provoking Arka to pull the trigger. If you stand between the crossbow and Sazza, you will gain Gale's approval. Telling Arka that vengeance eats people alive will gain you the approval of Shadowheart, but disapproval from Lae'zel. As the two tieflings walk away, you can engage in a conversation with Sazza. You can either choose to free her or let her rot in that cage.

Now exit through the door you just came in, on the northwest side, you'll meet Dammon, a smith within the grove. (X:180 Y:559). If you interact with him, you'll get to see what he has for sale. He's got a variety of weapons, armours, and shields among other items. Just a few steps ahead the northwest, you'll find Aradin (X:165 Y:546). You can make him give you the contract Stamped Handbill that made Halsin go with the other adventurers.

Also northeast at (X:193 Y:548), you'll see Auntie Ethel (the hag). She's a Merchant and will sell you a variety of Alchemical ingredients and consumables. If you leave her shop and speak to her again, you can bring up the fact that you've been infected with a mind flayer parasite. Astarion will approve of this, but Shadowheart will disapprove. She'll agree to help you with your parasite but mentions that none of the potions currently with her will be powerful enough. Auntie Ethel (the hag) will then mark her house on your map, pointing you towards the Sunlit Wetlands.

At the north entrance of The Hollow (X:257 Y:451), you'll see a group of tieflings in a heated argument against the druids. Komira wishes to see her daughter, Arabella. But Jeorna claims Komira's daughter is a thief and will wait for Kagha's judgement. Komira threatens to rip Jeorna's throat out if she doesn't let them pass, but another druid begins to transform into a bear to make them back off. Talking to Komira and Locke will start the quest Save Arabella. If you choose to help them Astarion will disapprove of this decision. Now head down the stairs and you'll have reached the Sacred Pool (X:262 Y:535). You can talk to Jeorna, she'll eventually let you through to see Kagha. Now make your way to the Stone Door just northwest (X:228 Y:521). Go through the door and just down the stairs, you'll see Kagha trying to intimidate Arabella with her serpent. She wishes to imprison the young tiefling on account of theft. Rath tries to reason with Kagha but she sees the tiefling the same. You can interrupt them and choose to save Arabella, if you choose to take responsibility of her, you'll gain Gale and Shadowheart's approval, but also gain Lae'zel's disapproval.

Now go to the Druids' Chambers (X:-443 Y:-6) and you'll find Nettie trying to patch up an injured bird. Once you interact with her, she'll tell you to give her a moment. You'll go through a lot of dialogue interactions with her but in the end, she'll reveal that she's mislead you, and that she doesn't have a cure, only a way out. If you don't swear to take the Wyvern Poison at the moment you show symptoms, Nettie will turn hostile saying she has no choice and you will have to kill her. If you do swear to take the poison, you will gain Lae'zel's approval, but get Shadowheart's and Astarion's disapproval. Nettie hopes it doesn't have to come to that but she thanks you, then hands you the Wyvern Poison.

Now that you've attempted to remove the parasite from your brain and rest, at any point in time you can meet Raphael. He then introduces himself and says he's at your service. He will eventually transport you in his place called "Middle-of-somewhere", and while he asks you to fill your plate, he also says this might be your last. Raphael will tranform into a devil and offers you a quick solution to your problem.  you call him mad, Astarion, Lae'zel, and Shadowheart will approve. He's hoping you'd change your mind down the road. At the end, he will transport you back at the place where he showed up.
