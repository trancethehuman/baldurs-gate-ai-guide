Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

Hunt the Devil

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:36  Girl ravaged not only the entire paladin hut, but friendly-fired my entire party. Reloaded and killed her. Exaggerated, boring and entirely useless character. Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5. Kill Karlach, then try to get a refund on this piece of time wasting software. ReplyReplies (5)6+1126-1 Submit

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval. Just be careful as the pixie will polymorph you for a turn or two which could leave you vulnerable depending on the situation. Also no long term consequences w/ Dolly, you can ring the bell again to get the blessing back.ReplyReplies (0)1+10-1 Submit

Anonymous20 Aug 2023 09:20  Ok.... screw Larian....So, I was doing Act 2, and I was afraid of possible timed quests, and I also got incredible buffs which only lasted until a long rest.So I refused to long rest in Act 2. When traveling to BG, I was forced on a long rest, and tried to talk with Karlach, nothing special happend (I did her companion quest, so there should have been an option)After than rest, I officially am in Act 3, again a forced long rest.I think, ok, let's talk to Karlach again. Now she proclaims there was something between us, but it blew out. So I'm now no longer romancing Karlach, simply because I didn't do a seperate long rest in Act 2.... that's bs...ReplyReplies (4)3+17-1 Submit

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again. To keep any sense of sanity I'll have to abuse Cheat Engine to just massively overpower myself so it doesn't take dozens of hours to get back to where I was.ReplyReplies (2)6+113-1 Submit

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:36  Girl ravaged not only the entire paladin hut, but friendly-fired my entire party. Reloaded and killed her. Exaggerated, boring and entirely useless character. Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5. Kill Karlach, then try to get a refund on this piece of time wasting software. ReplyReplies (5)6+1126-1 Submit

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval. Just be careful as the pixie will polymorph you for a turn or two which could leave you vulnerable depending on the situation. Also no long term consequences w/ Dolly, you can ring the bell again to get the blessing back.ReplyReplies (0)1+10-1 Submit

When traveling to BG, I was forced on a long rest, and tried to talk with Karlach, nothing special happend (I did her companion quest, so there should have been an option)After than rest, I officially am in Act 3, again a forced long rest.I think, ok, let's talk to Karlach again.

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Anonymous08 Aug 2023 06:02  *Act III and ENDING SPOILERS for romance*seems like you can't really do much for her problem beyond getting the engine 'upgraded' by Dammon twice and avenging her by killing Gortash once you get to Baldur's Gate (which concludes her companion quest) - but you can convince her at the very end while she's dying for you to both go to Avernus and stay there together (despite her previous objections throughout the story); it's kinda bittersweet but I guess it's the closest thing to a 'happy' ending if you don't want her to dieReplyReplies (1)9+11-1 Submit

Soulbinderblood12307 Aug 2023 10:00  I've tested it, Karlach is the only Companion every origin companion likes. Even Wyll approves if you defend Karlach and side against him. Lae'ze likes her for being Brash and strong. Astarion likes her for being an engine of violence. Shadowheart likes her for being a great fighther and being slightly horny.

If u don't have an orc jump with Lae'zel she will take ~22 dmg, then jump with main hero and revive him. Speak with Karlach and pick her up.

I don't know if the protagonist needs to do other things beforehand or go to act 2 via the mountain pass our path behind the goblin hideout, but taking the lift and going to the Inn definitely kills Dammon. You can talk to Dammon before the whole blessing event to fix up Karlach's engine (dialogue makes it seem temporary).I'm currently looking around the lower city in Baldur's Gate and it doesn't look like there is anyone else that can help :cReplyReplies (1)2+10-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

Hunt the Devil

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice.

Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you

Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:36  Girl ravaged not only the entire paladin hut, but friendly-fired my entire party. Reloaded and killed her. Exaggerated, boring and entirely useless character. Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5. Kill Karlach, then try to get a refund on this piece of time wasting software. ReplyReplies (5)6+1126-1 Submit

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval. Just be careful as the pixie will polymorph you for a turn or two which could leave you vulnerable depending on the situation. Also no long term consequences w/ Dolly, you can ring the bell again to get the blessing back.ReplyReplies (0)1+10-1 Submit

When traveling to BG, I was forced on a long rest, and tried to talk with Karlach, nothing special happend (I did her companion quest, so there should have been an option)After than rest, I officially am in Act 3, again a forced long rest.I think, ok, let's talk to Karlach again.

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5.

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval.

When traveling to BG, I was forced on a long rest, and tried to talk with Karlach, nothing special happend (I did her companion quest, so there should have been an option)After than rest, I officially am in Act 3, again a forced long rest.I think, ok, let's talk to Karlach again.

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

Actually, I can't even get Shadowheart's romance. Wyll was the only option I got and that was all the way back in act I. Withers even made fun of me for not picking anyone. Is there anything I can do???ReplyReplies (1)2+11-1 Submit

Anonymous14 Aug 2023 14:36  Her questline really needs more safeguards to prevent it from just ending due to reasons unknown to the player. Doing a blind playthrough makes it nearly impossible for her questline to continue. Like for example, who could've known ahead of time that killing the Strange Ox would make Dammon disappear?ReplyReplies (0)14+11-1 Submit

Anonymous12 Aug 2023 02:03  Is the Our Fiery Friend quest bugged? I killed the paladins before talking to them and the quest won't go away. Also, only Anders and Trynn spawned, but I see that someone else named Cyrel was supposed to spawn too. I don't know if they changed that or if that's the issue, but I'm afraid to progress because Karlach might leave when I begin Act 2ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit
Anonymous09 Aug 2023 12:51  She approves of Protecting Sazza, AND offering to Free Sazza. Mutually separate instances. As a reminder, freeing Sazza is one of the methods to gain an Oathbreaker Paladin. So depending on whom you choose, it may be worthwhile to combo that with her approval, maybe even turning Karlach into an Oathbreaker.ReplyReplies (2)1+10-1 Submit

Anonymous08 Aug 2023 06:02  *Act III and ENDING SPOILERS for romance*seems like you can't really do much for her problem beyond getting the engine 'upgraded' by Dammon twice and avenging her by killing Gortash once you get to Baldur's Gate (which concludes her companion quest) - but you can convince her at the very end while she's dying for you to both go to Avernus and stay there together (despite her previous objections throughout the story); it's kinda bittersweet but I guess it's the closest thing to a 'happy' ending if you don't want her to dieReplyReplies (1)9+11-1 Submit

Anonymous06 Aug 2023 17:49  Spoiler for Act 2I decided to proceed onwards to act 2 from the lift in grymforge and after getting a blessing at an Inn it seems like Dammon dies 100% of the time. I don't know if the protagonist needs to do other things beforehand or go to act 2 via the mountain pass our path behind the goblin hideout, but taking the lift and going to the Inn definitely kills Dammon. You can talk to Dammon before the whole blessing event to fix up Karlach's engine (dialogue makes it seem temporary).I'm currently looking around the lower city in Baldur's Gate and it doesn't look like there is anyone else that can help :cReplyReplies (1)2+10-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

Hunt the Devil

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:36  Girl ravaged not only the entire paladin hut, but friendly-fired my entire party. Reloaded and killed her. Exaggerated, boring and entirely useless character. Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5.

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval. Just be careful as the pixie will polymorph you for a turn or two which could leave you vulnerable depending on the situation. Also no long term consequences w/ Dolly, you can ring the bell again to get the blessing back.ReplyReplies (0)1+10-1 Submit

When traveling to BG, I was forced on a long rest, and tried to talk with Karlach, nothing special happend (I did her companion quest, so there should have been an option)After than rest, I officially am in Act 3, again a forced long rest.I think, ok, let's talk to Karlach again.

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5. Kill Karlach, then try to get a refund on this piece of time wasting software. ReplyReplies (5)6+1126-1 Submit

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval.

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.

Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

Hunt the Devil

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:36  Girl ravaged not only the entire paladin hut, but friendly-fired my entire party. Reloaded and killed her. Exaggerated, boring and entirely useless character. Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5.

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval.

When traveling to BG, I was forced on a long rest, and tried to talk with Karlach, nothing special happend (I did her companion quest, so there should have been an option)After than rest, I officially am in Act 3, again a forced long rest.I think, ok, let's talk to Karlach again.

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5.

For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5.

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval. Just be careful as the pixie will polymorph you for a turn or two which could leave you vulnerable depending on the situation. Also no long term consequences w/ Dolly, you can ring the bell again to get the blessing back.ReplyReplies (0)1+10-1 Submit

When traveling to BG, I was forced on a long rest, and tried to talk with Karlach, nothing special happend (I did her companion quest, so there should have been an option)After than rest, I officially am in Act 3, again a forced long rest.I think, ok, let's talk to Karlach again.

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5.

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval.

For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

Hunt the Devil

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:36  Girl ravaged not only the entire paladin hut, but friendly-fired my entire party. Reloaded and killed her. Exaggerated, boring and entirely useless character. Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5. Kill Karlach, then try to get a refund on this piece of time wasting software. ReplyReplies (5)6+1126-1 Submit

Since that moment there was nothing I could do to win her back over.I am not sure if anyone else had this happen as well? It is a bit of a shame.ReplyReplies (2)1+11-1 Submit

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval. Just be careful as the pixie will polymorph you for a turn or two which could leave you vulnerable depending on the situation. Also no long term consequences w/ Dolly, you can ring the bell again to get the blessing back.ReplyReplies (0)1+10-1 Submit

When traveling to BG, I was forced on a long rest, and tried to talk with Karlach, nothing special happend (I did her companion quest, so there should have been an option)After than rest, I officially am in Act 3, again a forced long rest.I think, ok, let's talk to Karlach again. Now she proclaims there was something between us, but it blew out. So I'm now no longer romancing Karlach, simply because I didn't do a seperate long rest in Act 2.... that's bs...ReplyReplies (4)3+17-1 Submit

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again. To keep any sense of sanity I'll have to abuse Cheat Engine to just massively overpower myself so it doesn't take dozens of hours to get back to where I was.ReplyReplies (2)6+113-1 Submit

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

BG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough
To complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Karlach
In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.
Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.
To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.
After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 
 
BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II
Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Karlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Karlach is both Violent and Compassionate.
Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil.
Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions.
Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights.
While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions.
All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member.
Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies
Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general.
Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees.
Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils.
Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.

All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice. 


 


Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus
Betray Karlach during the final battle
Must have The Dark Urge origin

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you
As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her
Claim the throne in Bhaal's name



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.


 
Karlach Tips and Notes

Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.
She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.
Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.
Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.
Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.
If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

## Karlach

Karlach is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.

 

I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.



Where to find Karlach in BG3
Karlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.
 
EARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE
 In Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.
Either get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.
Easier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

 

### BG3 How to Romance Karlach

In this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.

Additionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.

 

### BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I

Your relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.

To romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.

After you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by 

 

### BG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II

Act II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.

### All Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3



Karlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Free Orpheus
Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus

How to Obtain Ending:

Free Orpheus
Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together
Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you



ENDING DESCRIPTION
There is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:

Why you?
This isn't your sacrifice to make.
Better you than me.

Choose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:

If this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you.
No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve.
No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.

Choose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.
Orpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: "My people will remember you, tiefling." despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode. 
Next, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice.

This is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say "This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing." Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him.

You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.
Just as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.

### Karlach Tips and Notes

* Karlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery.

* She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus.

* Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger.

* Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion.

* Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'.

* If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.

Anonymous15 Sep 2023 23:31  I have quite a strong dislike for the overly nice, the Mary Sue in most games and Karlach is exactly that. Lae'zel, Minthara or Shadowheart can all be annoying at times, but it's those times that make them real and interesting. Karlach, on the other hand, is just plain boring and unbelievable. Doesn't help at all when her best pal Wyll is equally boring. ReplyReplies (1)4+114-1 Submit
Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Almost made me quit the game. But it's in line with the overall bad character design in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian once made good games but they failed miserably on this one. I can't recall a single moment I had fun with, mostly due to unlikable, so-called "companions" as Karlach. Not to speak of the bad state the game is in even days after release bug-wise (but that's the standard anyways), as well as the unbearable loading times on PS5. Kill Karlach, then try to get a refund on this piece of time wasting software. ReplyReplies (5)6+1126-1 Submit

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval.

When traveling to BG, I was forced on a long rest, and tried to talk with Karlach, nothing special happend (I did her companion quest, so there should have been an option)After than rest, I officially am in Act 3, again a forced long rest.I think, ok, let's talk to Karlach again.

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her.

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit

Anonymous11 Sep 2023 00:10  I was able to keep Karlach in my party even after siding with Minthara and killing the tieflings/druids. She was at ~60% approval before.Two trigger points will cause her to leave when you go down this dark path. 1st trigger: When you blow the druid horn + side with goblins, her approval goes to zero so she leaves next chance she gets close to you.To avoid this trigger I had her sperated from my party half a screen away from the noble's body in the nautiloid crash site. After I killed everyone in the druid enclave, I withered into a cleric, used speak to dead amulet, and offered burial rites to the noble to get Karlach's approval up a notch. She stopped auto leaving then.2nd trigger: When talking to Minthara after every is killed and she wants to use your body.To avoid this trigger, I had Karlach die beforehand. Interesting enough, the game resurrected her in camp and she act like nothing happened. Had to persuade Gale not to leave.Wyll left after trigger #1. Not sure if I had his approval higher could get him to stay as well.ReplyReplies (0)5+13-1 Submit

Anonymous12 Aug 2023 02:03  Is the Our Fiery Friend quest bugged? I killed the paladins before talking to them and the quest won't go away. Also, only Anders and Trynn spawned, but I see that someone else named Cyrel was supposed to spawn too. I don't know if they changed that or if that's the issue, but I'm afraid to progress because Karlach might leave when I begin Act 2ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous10 Aug 2023 08:02  (BIG ole SPOILERS below)I feel like Larian really dropped the ball pretty hard with Karlach. She's a very likeable character, possibly the only all of your companions seem to like from the very start (even that beautiful toad Lae'zel) and probably one of the most popular romance choices, and yet she has by far the weakest story arc whose companion quest is basically just a glorified fetch one with rest of it just pulling on player's hopes and making them feel like they can save her - not to mention that its culmination is just a part of the main quest that you simply can't miss even if you never recruited her (aka dealing with Gortash).I can't really tell if this is what they had in mind all along (because if 'doomed character' is that they were going for, then this is a pretty weak execution) - or if they simply ran out of time given how she's the very last Origin they've worked on, and as such isn't even featured on game cover.ReplyReplies (2)19+11-1 Submit
Anonymous09 Aug 2023 12:51  She approves of Protecting Sazza, AND offering to Free Sazza. Mutually separate instances. As a reminder, freeing Sazza is one of the methods to gain an Oathbreaker Paladin. So depending on whom you choose, it may be worthwhile to combo that with her approval, maybe even turning Karlach into an Oathbreaker.ReplyReplies (2)1+10-1 Submit

Anonymous08 Aug 2023 06:02  *Act III and ENDING SPOILERS for romance*seems like you can't really do much for her problem beyond getting the engine 'upgraded' by Dammon twice and avenging her by killing Gortash once you get to Baldur's Gate (which concludes her companion quest) - but you can convince her at the very end while she's dying for you to both go to Avernus and stay there together (despite her previous objections throughout the story); it's kinda bittersweet but I guess it's the closest thing to a 'happy' ending if you don't want her to dieReplyReplies (1)9+11-1 Submit

Anonymous06 Aug 2023 17:49  Spoiler for Act 2I decided to proceed onwards to act 2 from the lift in grymforge and after getting a blessing at an Inn it seems like Dammon dies 100% of the time. I don't know if the protagonist needs to do other things beforehand or go to act 2 via the mountain pass our path behind the goblin hideout, but taking the lift and going to the Inn definitely kills Dammon. You can talk to Dammon before the whole blessing event to fix up Karlach's engine (dialogue makes it seem temporary).I'm currently looking around the lower city in Baldur's Gate and it doesn't look like there is anyone else that can help :cReplyReplies (1)2+10-1 Submit

I'm now in act 2 and she talks about wanting to touch me and needing something to cool her down soon. Putting Ice/Water on her never worked.

In order to reapply it you need to ring the bell to summon the pixie back and will enter a dialogue with several options. Choosing the "snarl" option well give you Karlach approval. Just be careful as the pixie will polymorph you for a turn or two which could leave you vulnerable depending on the situation.

She's halfway across the map! Chances are you've done too much for the grove before you even find her. For all the great things Larian did, some of the bugs and the infuriatingly specific gameplay route you have to follow for Karlach's relationship makes me not even want to play anymore because it'd require starting all over again.

Is there anything I can do???ReplyReplies (1)2+11-1 Submit15 Aug 2023 10:00  I'm in act III with exceptional relationship but I can't get the romance dialogue to trigger.

Move to Zevlor hideout and climb on the mountain , then find a cliff with a chest and jump down if you playing as orc u will die and stand up with 1 hp. If u don't have an orc jump with Lae'zel she will take ~22 dmg, then jump with main hero and revive him. Speak with Karlach and pick her up.

I don't know if the protagonist needs to do other things beforehand or go to act 2 via the mountain pass our path behind the goblin hideout, but taking the lift and going to the Inn definitely kills Dammon. You can talk to Dammon before the whole blessing event to fix up Karlach's engine (dialogue makes it seem temporary).I'm currently looking around the lower city in Baldur's Gate and it doesn't look like there is anyone else that can help :cReplyReplies (1)2+10-1 Submit
