Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act III
To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.


 
Check out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

Am I missing something? Like the 2nd assault on the Druid Grove for it to pop? I've convinced him as a Fighter, as a Barbarian, as a Persuasion, as both a custom and as Lae. Nothin'.

I had her in my team for a very tiny amount of time, and in that period she was an absolute *sshat to everyone and everything. Constantly treating tieflings and others as complete inferiors. Somehow she proclaimed that me raiding the goblin camps made her wet while also sneering at me and treating me like trash. So yeah. Interesting character. Lots of personality. If you like roleplaying as a specific character/team, sure man. Go right on ahead. As for me though: Get her the f away from me please and thank you. In fact, lets get less d*ckheads in general, please. Now, if you like d*ckheads - that's fine. Not blaming you. D*ckhead is great. Good for you. Dig right in. You have your share of d*ckhead. Now lets get something not d*ckhead, please. Just a fraction. Lets try kindness. Is that a thing? It is a fantasy game after all.

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act III
To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.


 
Check out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act III
To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.


 
Check out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 14:51  ngl I was one of the first to crap on Lae'zel and find her annoying at best, but she definitely has the best story arc of all the companions in the game by far (even if she isn't necessarily my favorite companion per se).give her a chance if you're on the fence, you won't regret it - her story is legitimately one of (if not *the*) most interesting in the entire game.ReplyReplies (0)7+12-1 Submit
Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

I had her in my team for a very tiny amount of time, and in that period she was an absolute *sshat to everyone and everything. Constantly treating tieflings and others as complete inferiors. Somehow she proclaimed that me raiding the goblin camps made her wet while also sneering at me and treating me like trash. So yeah. Interesting character. Lots of personality. If you like roleplaying as a specific character/team, sure man. Go right on ahead. As for me though: Get her the f away from me please and thank you. In fact, lets get less d*ckheads in general, please. Now, if you like d*ckheads - that's fine. Not blaming you. D*ckhead is great. Good for you. Dig right in. You have your share of d*ckhead. Now lets get something not d*ckhead, please. Just a fraction. Lets try kindness. Is that a thing? It is a fantasy game after all.

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act III
To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.


 
Check out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances
Note this guide is a work in progress. The information below reflects what was available during Early Access. Some situations, flags and events may have changed. Please feel free to edit this page and contribute to the guide.

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act III
To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.


 
Check out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

If you like roleplaying as a specific character/team, sure man. Go right on ahead. As for me though: Get her the f away from me please and thank you. In fact, lets get less d*ckheads in general, please. Now, if you like d*ckheads - that's fine. Not blaming you. D*ckhead is great. Good for you. Dig right in. You have your share of d*ckhead. Now lets get something not d*ckhead, please. Just a fraction. Lets try kindness. Is that a thing? It is a fantasy game after all.

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

Am I missing something? Like the 2nd assault on the Druid Grove for it to pop? I've convinced him as a Fighter, as a Barbarian, as a Persuasion, as both a custom and as Lae. Nothin'. The only thing I can assume is that he needs to live after the second fight... but none of the other inspiration points have that delayed conditional effect, so I am very confused.ReplyReplies (0)1+10-1 Submit

Anonymous14 Jul 2023 00:50  A great character. Very interesting. Also super intolerable. I had her in my team for a very tiny amount of time, and in that period she was an absolute *sshat to everyone and everything. Constantly treating tieflings and others as complete inferiors. Somehow she proclaimed that me raiding the goblin camps made her wet while also sneering at me and treating me like trash. So yeah. Interesting character. Lots of personality. If you like roleplaying as a specific character/team, sure man. Go right on ahead. As for me though: Get her the f away from me please and thank you. In fact, lets get less d*ckheads in general, please. Now, if you like d*ckheads - that's fine. Not blaming you. D*ckhead is great. Good for you. Dig right in. You have your share of d*ckhead. Now lets get something not d*ckhead, please. Just a fraction. Lets try kindness. Is that a thing? It is a fantasy game after all. We should introduce some truly unimaginable fantasy related aspects like mutual respect and kindness. Sure isn't any of that IRL. Now I can get treated like trash both IRL and in my fantasy games. Amazing. ReplyReplies (2)22+146-1 Submit

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

Somehow she proclaimed that me raiding the goblin camps made her wet while also sneering at me and treating me like trash. So yeah. Interesting character. Lots of personality. If you like roleplaying as a specific character/team, sure man. Go right on ahead. As for me though: Get her the f away from me please and thank you. In fact, lets get less d*ckheads in general, please. Now, if you like d*ckheads - that's fine. Not blaming you. D*ckhead is great. Good for you. Dig right in. You have your share of d*ckhead. Now lets get something not d*ckhead, please. Just a fraction. Lets try kindness. Is that a thing? It is a fantasy game after all.

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!

During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.

Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

I had her in my team for a very tiny amount of time, and in that period she was an absolute *sshat to everyone and everything. Constantly treating tieflings and others as complete inferiors. Somehow she proclaimed that me raiding the goblin camps made her wet while also sneering at me and treating me like trash. So yeah. Interesting character. Lots of personality. If you like roleplaying as a specific character/team, sure man. Go right on ahead. As for me though: Get her the f away from me please and thank you. In fact, lets get less d*ckheads in general, please. Now, if you like d*ckheads - that's fine. Not blaming you. D*ckhead is great. Good for you. Dig right in. You have your share of d*ckhead. Now lets get something not d*ckhead, please. Just a fraction. Lets try kindness. Is that a thing? It is a fantasy game after all. We should introduce some truly unimaginable fantasy related aspects like mutual respect and kindness. Sure isn't any of that IRL. Now I can get treated like trash both IRL and in my fantasy games. Amazing. ReplyReplies (2)22+146-1 Submit

Anonymous14 Nov 2022 02:42  I found it surprisingly easy to romance her, on my latest play, while still being a good person - saving Arabella, making sympathetic choices, etc.  Of course, I did skip a few little things that probably would've lowered her approval with the choices I'd have made, but doing things that the whole party approved of - killing the dead dwarf's parasite, making Crusher kiss my character's feet instead, etc., seemed to be enough.  Along with letting her speak for herself, during her conversations with Zorru and the Gith party.  ReplyReplies (0)10+10-1 Submit

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 14:51  ngl I was one of the first to crap on Lae'zel and find her annoying at best, but she definitely has the best story arc of all the companions in the game by far (even if she isn't necessarily my favorite companion per se).give her a chance if you're on the fence, you won't regret it - her story is legitimately one of (if not *the*) most interesting in the entire game.ReplyReplies (0)7+12-1 Submit
Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

I had her in my team for a very tiny amount of time, and in that period she was an absolute *sshat to everyone and everything. Constantly treating tieflings and others as complete inferiors. Somehow she proclaimed that me raiding the goblin camps made her wet while also sneering at me and treating me like trash. So yeah. Interesting character. Lots of personality. If you like roleplaying as a specific character/team, sure man. Go right on ahead. As for me though: Get her the f away from me please and thank you. In fact, lets get less d*ckheads in general, please. Now, if you like d*ckheads - that's fine. Not blaming you. D*ckhead is great. Good for you. Dig right in. You have your share of d*ckhead. Now lets get something not d*ckhead, please. Just a fraction. Lets try kindness. Is that a thing? It is a fantasy game after all.

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.

To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.


 
Check out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

The Githyanki Warrior

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act III
To be updated when more information is available.
 
Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 14:51  ngl I was one of the first to crap on Lae'zel and find her annoying at best, but she definitely has the best story arc of all the companions in the game by far (even if she isn't necessarily my favorite companion per se).give her a chance if you're on the fence, you won't regret it - her story is legitimately one of (if not *the*) most interesting in the entire game.ReplyReplies (0)7+12-1 Submit
Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

In fact, lets get less d*ckheads in general, please. Now, if you like d*ckheads - that's fine. Not blaming you. D*ckhead is great. Good for you. Dig right in. You have your share of d*ckhead. Now lets get something not d*ckhead, please. Just a fraction. Lets try kindness. Is that a thing? It is a fantasy game after all.

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough
Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel
In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 
To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.
You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!
 
BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II
During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.

Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Loud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes.
Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence.
Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked.
It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way.
Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree.
Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche.
Her few instances of "Good Deeds" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty.
Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach).
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.

Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.


 
 
Lae'zel Tips and Notes

First Blood of the Absolute buildShe is dressed to be a shock troop for this build. She softens the enemy and can take hits. Use her Shield of Faith and her Color Spray every fight you can. (Unless you only use Absolute's Warboard and only have the Shield of Faith 1/short rest.)

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow
 
Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.
Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.
If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

## Lae'Zel

Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.

 

Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.



Where to find Lae'Zel in BG3
Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.
She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.
Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.

### BG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough

Lae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

 

### BG3 How to Romance Lae'zel

In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her. 

To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.

 

### BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I

Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.

You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!

 

### BG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II

During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - "source of my bruises" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.

### Lae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3

If you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

### Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3



Orpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Reject the Emperor's offer to work together
Free Orpheus
Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:

Someone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that?
There has to be another way.
I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer.
I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it.
This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.

Choose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:

You are a true hero.
Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.

Choosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. 
Later on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people. 
Then, you will get the following options:

You should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you.
[PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.

If you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:

You don't deserve to die.
You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you?
Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.

Agree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.

Helmet (metal)
Githyanki Half Plate
Gloves of Power (Branded)
Metallic Boots
Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) 
    
Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice
 
Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense)
Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow

* Lae'zel can make a suitable candidate for Eldritch Knight, if given the Warped Headband of Intellect.

* Allowing her to cut your throat in camp will remove her as a viable party member.  She will still have the option in conversation to join your party, and will agree to join you.  However, she will no longer be able to join your party.

* If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche.  After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous18 Aug 2023 06:49  If you start her romance BEFORE you trigger anyone else, it locks out their options, forcing you to end it with Shadowheart before those scenes will show up. I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

In fact, lets get less d*ckheads in general, please. Now, if you like d*ckheads - that's fine. Not blaming you. D*ckhead is great. Good for you. Dig right in. You have your share of d*ckhead. Now lets get something not d*ckhead, please. Just a fraction. Lets try kindness. Is that a thing? It is a fantasy game after all.

Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

 Submit Submit Submit* Anonymous19 Aug 2023 02:57  Lae'zel is a solo romance. Figured out why the rest were not showing up. You can "shop" around, so to speak, but overall, once you commit to ANYONE, BEFORE, Lae'zel. She will turn you down, even though the prompt to engage remains open the entire time. I imagine it has something to do with background flags, and the only member to outright have sexual relations extremely early with you is Astarion. Which MAY influence that, though I suspect it's closer to having engaged, and reciprocated activities with other romance candidates en masse. If you engage with Lae'zel early, no one elses scenes will show up, and vice versa. All things considered, that's more an issue of trying to engage with too much content at the same time, instead of doing specific routes. Overall, she's difficult to get along with, even if I am rather fond of her, compared to Astarian and Wyll. Gale is just... eh? Shadowheart is the Tsundere standard, and Karlach gets the short end of the stick, so I've read. In that I mean, short on end game content for Karlach specifically. In essence, the same issue as Minthara. Which is a dedicated run in itself... TL:DR - Lae'zel is a solo romance. That's it. No one else involved. You're her plaything, and is willing to cede, on rare occasion the reins in that relationship. Compared to Minthara where you're just her slave. As is tradition.ReplyReplies (2)0+10-1 Submit

I'd assume the same for Gale as well, as I triggered his on a prior game, but I had intentionally not selected to romance Lae'zel at the time, but I did make the choice for Shadowheart. As such, I am fairly certain, engaging Lae'zel in a relationship places a softlock on other romances. I notably had access to the "Think we missed our chance to know each other." on Shadowheart, AND "You've been lookin' at me different." on Lae'zel at the same time. I went with Lae'zel, and when I tried speaking to Shadowheart to engage her, the option was gone. When I said "Flings done." to Lae'zel, the option showed up for Shadowheart again. If someone else could get confirmation for this, that would be great.ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

I've convinced the fool a dozen times and then some, and it never pops. Am I missing something? Like the 2nd assault on the Druid Grove for it to pop? I've convinced him as a Fighter, as a Barbarian, as a Persuasion, as both a custom and as Lae. Nothin'. The only thing I can assume is that he needs to live after the second fight... but none of the other inspiration points have that delayed conditional effect, so I am very confused.ReplyReplies (0)1+10-1 Submit

Along with letting her speak for herself, during her conversations with Zorru and the Gith party.  ReplyReplies (0)10+10-1 Submit
