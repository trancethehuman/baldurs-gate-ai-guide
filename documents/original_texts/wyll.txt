Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

 


Where to find Wyll in BG3
Wyll will first be encountered during the Goblin Raid for Druid's Grove in Act I. The area would be directly north of the Ravaged Beach/Nautiloid Crash Site

BG3 Wyll Quest Walkthrough
To complete Wyll's Questline, you must first meet him after winning the Battle against the Goblin raiding party attacking Druid's Grove. Upon finishing that, talk to him in the Training area past the massive gate where he would instructing the Tiefling Children in the basics of sword fighting. 
Talking to him after his cutscene reveals he also has the Tadpole and gives you the option to recruit him as a companion. Wyll will mention his personal quest and upon joining the party will begin his companion quest:

The Blade of Frontiers

 
Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

 
Wyll Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Wyll, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

The 2nd companion  with the easiest way to gain approval. This is due a lot of his positive approval instances is just simply doing heroic or good deeds which has a lot of opportunities.
Does not like evil/bad deeds.
Unlike Gale however, he has instances of moral weaknesses especially situations with the Goblins.
In Gale's personal quest sticking by Wyll is a pretty straightforward way in gaining his approval.
Will leave the player if the choice is made to side with the goblins.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:50  Just had a weird bug. Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask... I am playing with mods, but nothing that should cause this (my mods are quality of life improvements: expanded item highlights, reusable dyes, and NPCs don't react to summons). Anyone else encounter this?ReplyReplies (1)2+12-1 Submit

Anonymous27 Aug 2023 17:47  I really tried liking this dude and making him my bro but he's just legitimately boring. His conflict and interactions with Mizora were quite interesting; but beyond that, man has the charisma of a boulder that provides absolutely no incentive to be invested in his development - it's ironically the opposite of Karlach who has practically no story arc beyond a fetch quest but still manages to pull players into it thanks to how much fun of a character she is.ReplyReplies (1)11+18-1 Submit

He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame.

Anonymous30 Oct 2020 12:28  What even are those stats. They present Wyll is a swordsman, so why is his intelligence better than both his strength and dexterity? Why is his dexterity *that* low? Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)6+17-1 Submit

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

 


Where to find Wyll in BG3
Wyll will first be encountered during the Goblin Raid for Druid's Grove in Act I. The area would be directly north of the Ravaged Beach/Nautiloid Crash Site

BG3 Wyll Quest Walkthrough
To complete Wyll's Questline, you must first meet him after winning the Battle against the Goblin raiding party attacking Druid's Grove. Upon finishing that, talk to him in the Training area past the massive gate where he would instructing the Tiefling Children in the basics of sword fighting. 
Talking to him after his cutscene reveals he also has the Tadpole and gives you the option to recruit him as a companion. Wyll will mention his personal quest and upon joining the party will begin his companion quest:

The Blade of Frontiers

 
Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

 
Wyll Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Wyll, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

The 2nd companion  with the easiest way to gain approval. This is due a lot of his positive approval instances is just simply doing heroic or good deeds which has a lot of opportunities.
Does not like evil/bad deeds.
Unlike Gale however, he has instances of moral weaknesses especially situations with the Goblins.
In Gale's personal quest sticking by Wyll is a pretty straightforward way in gaining his approval.
Will leave the player if the choice is made to side with the goblins.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.


WARNING

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:50  Just had a weird bug. Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask... I am playing with mods, but nothing that should cause this (my mods are quality of life improvements: expanded item highlights, reusable dyes, and NPCs don't react to summons). Anyone else encounter this?ReplyReplies (1)2+12-1 Submit
Anonymous01 Sep 2023 15:42  Bug with Wyll's quest to kill karlach failing even when karlach is dead and her head is in my pockets:- Leaving chapter 1 before long resting until Wyll finishes his quest to kill karlach- Wyll will fail, no matter what- Long resting is requiredI ran into this bug, I only long rested twice in chapter 1, I was so confused.Apparently you can long rest for free if there's a cutscene at night.So basically, ALWAYS click long rest and decline the item selection, to see if there are cutscenes that are unplayed before leaving chapter 1.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous27 Aug 2023 17:47  I really tried liking this dude and making him my bro but he's just legitimately boring. His conflict and interactions with Mizora were quite interesting; but beyond that, man has the charisma of a boulder that provides absolutely no incentive to be invested in his development - it's ironically the opposite of Karlach who has practically no story arc beyond a fetch quest but still manages to pull players into it thanks to how much fun of a character she is.ReplyReplies (1)11+18-1 Submit

He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame.

Anonymous30 Oct 2020 12:28  What even are those stats. They present Wyll is a swordsman, so why is his intelligence better than both his strength and dexterity? Why is his dexterity *that* low? Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)6+17-1 Submit

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

 


Where to find Wyll in BG3
Wyll will first be encountered during the Goblin Raid for Druid's Grove in Act I. The area would be directly north of the Ravaged Beach/Nautiloid Crash Site

BG3 Wyll Quest Walkthrough
To complete Wyll's Questline, you must first meet him after winning the Battle against the Goblin raiding party attacking Druid's Grove. Upon finishing that, talk to him in the Training area past the massive gate where he would instructing the Tiefling Children in the basics of sword fighting. 
Talking to him after his cutscene reveals he also has the Tadpole and gives you the option to recruit him as a companion. Wyll will mention his personal quest and upon joining the party will begin his companion quest:

The Blade of Frontiers

 
Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

 
Wyll Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Wyll, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

The 2nd companion  with the easiest way to gain approval. This is due a lot of his positive approval instances is just simply doing heroic or good deeds which has a lot of opportunities.
Does not like evil/bad deeds.
Unlike Gale however, he has instances of moral weaknesses especially situations with the Goblins.
In Gale's personal quest sticking by Wyll is a pretty straightforward way in gaining his approval.
Will leave the player if the choice is made to side with the goblins.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:50  Just had a weird bug. Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask... I am playing with mods, but nothing that should cause this (my mods are quality of life improvements: expanded item highlights, reusable dyes, and NPCs don't react to summons). Anyone else encounter this?ReplyReplies (1)2+12-1 Submit
Anonymous01 Sep 2023 15:42  Bug with Wyll's quest to kill karlach failing even when karlach is dead and her head is in my pockets:- Leaving chapter 1 before long resting until Wyll finishes his quest to kill karlach- Wyll will fail, no matter what- Long resting is requiredI ran into this bug, I only long rested twice in chapter 1, I was so confused.Apparently you can long rest for free if there's a cutscene at night.So basically, ALWAYS click long rest and decline the item selection, to see if there are cutscenes that are unplayed before leaving chapter 1.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous27 Aug 2023 17:47  I really tried liking this dude and making him my bro but he's just legitimately boring. His conflict and interactions with Mizora were quite interesting; but beyond that, man has the charisma of a boulder that provides absolutely no incentive to be invested in his development - it's ironically the opposite of Karlach who has practically no story arc beyond a fetch quest but still manages to pull players into it thanks to how much fun of a character she is.ReplyReplies (1)11+18-1 Submit

He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame. Also, how is the dude who sold his soul to a fiend for power going judge me on my moral decisions?ReplyReplies (3)20+112-1 Submit

Anonymous30 Oct 2020 12:28  What even are those stats. They present Wyll is a swordsman, so why is his intelligence better than both his strength and dexterity? Why is his dexterity *that* low? Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)6+17-1 Submit

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

 


Where to find Wyll in BG3
Wyll will first be encountered during the Goblin Raid for Druid's Grove in Act I. The area would be directly north of the Ravaged Beach/Nautiloid Crash Site

BG3 Wyll Quest Walkthrough
To complete Wyll's Questline, you must first meet him after winning the Battle against the Goblin raiding party attacking Druid's Grove. Upon finishing that, talk to him in the Training area past the massive gate where he would instructing the Tiefling Children in the basics of sword fighting. 
Talking to him after his cutscene reveals he also has the Tadpole and gives you the option to recruit him as a companion. Wyll will mention his personal quest and upon joining the party will begin his companion quest:

The Blade of Frontiers

 
Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

 
Wyll Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Wyll, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

The 2nd companion  with the easiest way to gain approval. This is due a lot of his positive approval instances is just simply doing heroic or good deeds which has a lot of opportunities.
Does not like evil/bad deeds.
Unlike Gale however, he has instances of moral weaknesses especially situations with the Goblins.
In Gale's personal quest sticking by Wyll is a pretty straightforward way in gaining his approval.
Will leave the player if the choice is made to side with the goblins.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:50  Just had a weird bug. Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask... I am playing with mods, but nothing that should cause this (my mods are quality of life improvements: expanded item highlights, reusable dyes, and NPCs don't react to summons).

His conflict and interactions with Mizora were quite interesting; but beyond that, man has the charisma of a boulder that provides absolutely no incentive to be invested in his development - it's ironically the opposite of Karlach who has practically no story arc beyond a fetch quest but still manages to pull players into it thanks to how much fun of a character she is.ReplyReplies (1)11+18-1 Submit

He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame. Also, how is the dude who sold his soul to a fiend for power going judge me on my moral decisions?ReplyReplies (3)20+112-1 Submit

Anonymous30 Oct 2020 12:28  What even are those stats. They present Wyll is a swordsman, so why is his intelligence better than both his strength and dexterity? Why is his dexterity *that* low? Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)6+17-1 Submit

Anonymous20 Oct 2020 02:35  Wait, hold up. Warlocks are only proficient in simple weapons, so how is Wyll able to wield rapiers? Did my guy really sell his soul for fencing lessons?!ReplyReplies (4)16+10-1 Submit
Anonymous19 Oct 2020 02:17  one of the goblins in the goblin camp building (temple of selune) has his eye as a drop. if you kill them all without him, he is angry about you not bringing him. it also seems to bug or nullify any chance having his missing eye push his story forward, though i'm not sure if the game currently has something where he mentions the eye (assuming it does) if you bring him with you and confront/fight the small group of goblins carrying it.ReplyReplies (0)3+11-1 Submit

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

 


Where to find Wyll in BG3
Wyll will first be encountered during the Goblin Raid for Druid's Grove in Act I. The area would be directly north of the Ravaged Beach/Nautiloid Crash Site

BG3 Wyll Quest Walkthrough
To complete Wyll's Questline, you must first meet him after winning the Battle against the Goblin raiding party attacking Druid's Grove. Upon finishing that, talk to him in the Training area past the massive gate where he would instructing the Tiefling Children in the basics of sword fighting.

The Blade of Frontiers

 
Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

 
Wyll Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Wyll, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

The 2nd companion  with the easiest way to gain approval. This is due a lot of his positive approval instances is just simply doing heroic or good deeds which has a lot of opportunities.
Does not like evil/bad deeds.
Unlike Gale however, he has instances of moral weaknesses especially situations with the Goblins.
In Gale's personal quest sticking by Wyll is a pretty straightforward way in gaining his approval.
Will leave the player if the choice is made to side with the goblins.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.


WARNING
MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
NOTE: WYLL CHARACTER WILL BE REWRITTEN HEAVILY FOR FULL RELEASE. SO THE APPROVAL GUIDE CHANGE DRASTICALLY WITH FULL RELEASE.
Check out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:50  Just had a weird bug. Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask... I am playing with mods, but nothing that should cause this (my mods are quality of life improvements: expanded item highlights, reusable dyes, and NPCs don't react to summons). Anyone else encounter this?ReplyReplies (1)2+12-1 Submit
Anonymous01 Sep 2023 15:42  Bug with Wyll's quest to kill karlach failing even when karlach is dead and her head is in my pockets:- Leaving chapter 1 before long resting until Wyll finishes his quest to kill karlach- Wyll will fail, no matter what- Long resting is requiredI ran into this bug, I only long rested twice in chapter 1, I was so confused.Apparently you can long rest for free if there's a cutscene at night.So basically, ALWAYS click long rest and decline the item selection, to see if there are cutscenes that are unplayed before leaving chapter 1.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous27 Aug 2023 17:47  I really tried liking this dude and making him my bro but he's just legitimately boring. His conflict and interactions with Mizora were quite interesting; but beyond that, man has the charisma of a boulder that provides absolutely no incentive to be invested in his development - it's ironically the opposite of Karlach who has practically no story arc beyond a fetch quest but still manages to pull players into it thanks to how much fun of a character she is.ReplyReplies (1)11+18-1 Submit

He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame.

Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)6+17-1 Submit

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:50  Just had a weird bug. Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask... I am playing with mods, but nothing that should cause this (my mods are quality of life improvements: expanded item highlights, reusable dyes, and NPCs don't react to summons). Anyone else encounter this?ReplyReplies (1)2+12-1 Submit
Anonymous01 Sep 2023 15:42  Bug with Wyll's quest to kill karlach failing even when karlach is dead and her head is in my pockets:- Leaving chapter 1 before long resting until Wyll finishes his quest to kill karlach- Wyll will fail, no matter what- Long resting is requiredI ran into this bug, I only long rested twice in chapter 1, I was so confused.Apparently you can long rest for free if there's a cutscene at night.So basically, ALWAYS click long rest and decline the item selection, to see if there are cutscenes that are unplayed before leaving chapter 1.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous27 Aug 2023 17:47  I really tried liking this dude and making him my bro but he's just legitimately boring. His conflict and interactions with Mizora were quite interesting; but beyond that, man has the charisma of a boulder that provides absolutely no incentive to be invested in his development - it's ironically the opposite of Karlach who has practically no story arc beyond a fetch quest but still manages to pull players into it thanks to how much fun of a character she is.ReplyReplies (1)11+18-1 Submit

He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame.

Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything.

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.

Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring

The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again.

Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask... I am playing with mods, but nothing that should cause this (my mods are quality of life improvements: expanded item highlights, reusable dyes, and NPCs don't react to summons). Anyone else encounter this?ReplyReplies (1)2+12-1 Submit

His conflict and interactions with Mizora were quite interesting; but beyond that, man has the charisma of a boulder that provides absolutely no incentive to be invested in his development - it's ironically the opposite of Karlach who has practically no story arc beyond a fetch quest but still manages to pull players into it thanks to how much fun of a character she is.ReplyReplies (1)11+18-1 Submit

I made him a Pact of the Blade Warlock and Great Weapon Master using Sorrow at first and then a better Halberd I bought at Act II.

Anonymous08 Aug 2023 00:24  I kinda hate Wyll. I feel like I'm getting constantly gaslighted by him. If I do something minor like intimidate someone his disapproval message pops up. He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame. Also, how is the dude who sold his soul to a fiend for power going judge me on my moral decisions?ReplyReplies (3)20+112-1 Submit

Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)6+17-1 Submit

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

 
Wyll Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

I made him a Pact of the Blade Warlock and Great Weapon Master using Sorrow at first and then a better Halberd I bought at Act II.

Anonymous08 Aug 2023 00:24  I kinda hate Wyll. I feel like I'm getting constantly gaslighted by him. If I do something minor like intimidate someone his disapproval message pops up. He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame. Also, how is the dude who sold his soul to a fiend for power going judge me on my moral decisions?ReplyReplies (3)20+112-1 Submit

Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)6+17-1 Submit

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask...

Anonymous08 Aug 2023 00:24  I kinda hate Wyll. I feel like I'm getting constantly gaslighted by him. If I do something minor like intimidate someone his disapproval message pops up. He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame. Also, how is the dude who sold his soul to a fiend for power going judge me on my moral decisions?ReplyReplies (3)20+112-1 Submit

Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)6+17-1 Submit

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

 


Where to find Wyll in BG3

Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

 
Wyll Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask...

Anonymous08 Aug 2023 00:24  I kinda hate Wyll. I feel like I'm getting constantly gaslighted by him. If I do something minor like intimidate someone his disapproval message pops up. He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame. Also, how is the dude who sold his soul to a fiend for power going judge me on my moral decisions?ReplyReplies (3)20+112-1 Submit

Anonymous30 Oct 2020 12:28  What even are those stats. They present Wyll is a swordsman, so why is his intelligence better than both his strength and dexterity? Why is his dexterity *that* low? Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)6+17-1 Submit

Wyll is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Wyll made his name as a renowned hero in Baldur's Gate. But to become a living legend, he struck a bargain with a devil, a bargain from which he longs to break free before it consumes his soul for good.
 

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

 


Where to find Wyll in BG3
Wyll will first be encountered during the Goblin Raid for Druid's Grove in Act I. The area would be directly north of the Ravaged Beach/Nautiloid Crash Site

Wyll Romance Guide for BG3
Wyll becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. (At the very least, Medium Approval). Below are the special conditions for pursuing it:

Being able to access Wyll's Romance relies on helping him pursue his companion quest. 
In the Early Access, this means trying to find Mizura but the Full release mentions a massive rewrite in Wyll's character.
Either way, the first steps would need for the player to help Wyll with their Quest to both raise his approval but also his personal plot which allows him to open up more and deepen the relationship with the player.
Second Important thing is to not choose to side with Wyll. Wyll will leave the player if s/he sides with the Goblins.
After following with his personal quest, he will start to be more open with his past with the player during Camp at night.

 
Wyll Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3
If you are looking to befriend or romance Wyll, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask...

Anonymous08 Aug 2023 00:24  I kinda hate Wyll. I feel like I'm getting constantly gaslighted by him. If I do something minor like intimidate someone his disapproval message pops up. He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame. Also, how is the dude who sold his soul to a fiend for power going judge me on my moral decisions?ReplyReplies (3)20+112-1 Submit

Anonymous30 Oct 2020 12:28  What even are those stats. They present Wyll is a swordsman, so why is his intelligence better than both his strength and dexterity? Why is his dexterity *that* low? Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit
Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION] - This is a copy/paste from my comment on the Astarion page because I thought it might be useful to some people here as well.I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything.

They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.

Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.

Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.


 
Wyll Tips and Notes

Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 
Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 
Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers
Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

### Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3



Wyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Set for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora

How to Obtain Ending:

Encourage will to break the contract
Keep Wyll alive until the very end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
It turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Wyll is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.
Mizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:

She will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact.
She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.

If you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:

What will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact?
Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild.
Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live.
Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom.
Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.

Choose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.
Now that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.

### Wyll Tips and Notes

* Fire Warlock build 
  
Leather Helmet
Leather Armour +1
Metallic Gloves
Spiderstep Boots
Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp
Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1
 

* Leather Helmet

* Leather Armour +1

* Metallic Gloves

* Spiderstep Boots

* Ritual Axe and Dragon's Grasp

* Neck: Amulet of Elemental Torment Ring: Ring of Poison Resistance Ring: Crusher's Ring

* Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

* Early access: It's possible for Wyll to die during the goblin battle. He may also get stuck at the gate afterwards, repeating "you'll have plenty of time to thank me later" and never moving towards the training area or giving his recruitment dialogue. The only known way to fix this is by reloading an earlier save from before the battle and trying again. 

* Wyll has innate proficiency with rapiers

* Pursuing the Mizora Romance plate will make Wyll very pissed. Like going with this storyline is a constant source of Wyll disapproval

Anonymous05 Sep 2023 18:50  Just had a weird bug. Started a new game and Wyll spawned in my game with a mask called "Not Found" that grants a bonus spell slot and his character portrait is also wearing the mask... I am playing with mods, but nothing that should cause this (my mods are quality of life improvements: expanded item highlights, reusable dyes, and NPCs don't react to summons). Anyone else encounter this?ReplyReplies (1)2+12-1 Submit
Anonymous01 Sep 2023 15:42  Bug with Wyll's quest to kill karlach failing even when karlach is dead and her head is in my pockets:- Leaving chapter 1 before long resting until Wyll finishes his quest to kill karlach- Wyll will fail, no matter what- Long resting is requiredI ran into this bug, I only long rested twice in chapter 1, I was so confused.Apparently you can long rest for free if there's a cutscene at night.So basically, ALWAYS click long rest and decline the item selection, to see if there are cutscenes that are unplayed before leaving chapter 1.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

His conflict and interactions with Mizora were quite interesting; but beyond that, man has the charisma of a boulder that provides absolutely no incentive to be invested in his development - it's ironically the opposite of Karlach who has practically no story arc beyond a fetch quest but still manages to pull players into it thanks to how much fun of a character she is.ReplyReplies (1)11+18-1 Submit

Anonymous08 Aug 2023 00:24  I kinda hate Wyll. I feel like I'm getting constantly gaslighted by him. If I do something minor like intimidate someone his disapproval message pops up. He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame.

Anonymous30 Oct 2020 12:28  What even are those stats. They present Wyll is a swordsman, so why is his intelligence better than both his strength and dexterity? Why is his dexterity *that* low? Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14. Even then you are better off with eldritch blast 90% of the time.ReplyReplies (5)25+12-1 Submit

Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything.

He's constantly lying to me in dialogue about his origins and quest. My first playthrough was as a wizard and it gave me a dialogue option pointing out that his fake right eye is an active sending stone. He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something. Some of the other characters will lie to you but mostly they'll just say somethings private and they don't want to talk about it. Wyll will lie to your face without any shame.

He gaslights me and says it's just a bloodstone to remind him of the price of blood or something.

Why is his dexterity *that* low? Anyone who doesn't pay attention to stats when they pick Wyll up will try to use him as he was used in the goblin fight at the gate, they will send him into melee. And they will suffer, because Wyll is *terrible* at melee combat. The only way to make him remotely good at it is to give him moderately armored at 4th level to plug his terrible AC, and bring his dex to a *passable* 14.

Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything.

Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)
