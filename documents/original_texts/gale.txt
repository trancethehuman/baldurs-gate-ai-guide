Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit
Anonymous31 Aug 2023 23:04  As a Paladin in the Emerald Grove, if you offer to heal Pandirna in the storage room for free, you'll get + Approval from Gale (not if you do it for a price).ReplyReplies (0)1+10-1 Submit
Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)20+10-1 Submit

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)20+10-1 Submit

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)20+10-1 Submit

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."

Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."

If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)20+10-1 Submit

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)20+10-1 Submit

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)20+10-1 Submit

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)20+10-1 Submit

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)20+10-1 Submit

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything.

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)ReplyReplies (1)20+10-1 Submit

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

Anonymous04 Sep 2023 13:42  In regards to his romance - It's a literal either or scenario. If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Anonymous31 Aug 2023 15:46  Gale will not survive any subsequent playthroughs with me, not because "he ate all my magic artifacts" (which admittedly is a valid argument to hate him already), but because he is picky about which artifacts he eats. Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything.

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.
Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.

Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough
To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 
WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
 
BG3 How to Romance Gale
In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.
 
 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.
As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 
BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I
Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.
You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

Gale Approval Guide
If you are looking to befriend or romance Gale, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips

Is arguably the most morally upstanding companion (as of early access) and thus the easiest person to gain approval by simply helping out, and committing to doing side quests.
Likes helping people and all around good deeds.
Hates bad deeds (As of early access). Unlike other companions, he dislikes most if not all morally questionable deeds and has the most instances of disapproval from them.
Giving Artifacts to be consumed is also an easy way to gain approval.
Enjoys having and petting the Camp Animals.
This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion
To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.
Hates having his mind invaded and or breaching his privacy.

Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3


Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."


 


Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.


 


Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.


 


Gale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
Similar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

If you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:

I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down.
I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.


 


Gale becomes Illithid
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end
Choose the dialogue options below



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers, and asks what are your plans with them.

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Make sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:

Perhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./
Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.

Choose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result to Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.


 
Gale Tips and Notes

It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.
 
Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)
Neck: Amulet of Misty Step Ring: Guiding Light Ring: The Mage's Friend
Optional: Any Light Crossbow +1

## Gale

Gale is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Gale can be met at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in the Ravaged Beach during Act 1. Gale is a Human Wizard that can join your party and contribute powerful spells in combat. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.

Gale is a wizard prodigy whose love for a goddess made him attempt a dread feat no mortal should. Blighted by the forbidden magic of ancient Netheril, Gale strives to undo the corruption that is overtaking him and win back his goddess’ favour before he becomes a destroyer of worlds.





Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time is not on his side.



Where to find Gale in BG3
Gale can be found after the crash of the Nautiloid in Act 1. You will meet Gale by exploring the central portion of the Ravaged Beach and interacting with the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint. The waypoint is acting strangely, and touching it will give you the opportunity to rescue and recruit Gale into your party See Gale's Location on the BG3 Map.

### BG3 Gale Quest Walkthrough

To complete Gale's Questline, you must first meet him in the central area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. You must rescue him from inside a portal (Roadside Cliff Waypoint), after which you can have him join your party. This will begin his quest:

* The Wizard of Waterdeep 

 

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

 

### BG3 How to Romance Gale

In this Gale Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Gale's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.

 

 Gale becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Gale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.

As a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances. 

### BG3 Gale Romance Guide Act I

Your relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.

You're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.

### Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3



Gale Destroys the Elder Brain
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Travel to Mind Flayer Colony
Tell Gale to: "Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together."

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the dialogue options below.



ENDING DESCRIPTION
This is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.
Upon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:

Gale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death.
Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.

If you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, "One last gale to end them all". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.
Soon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, "It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."

Gale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale origin
Gale must climb atop alone.

How to Obtain Ending:

When Gale tells you "I'm ready. Are you?" Reply to him with the second option: "Wait. We  could end this now if  you unleashed the orb."
Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: "We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now."



ENDING DESCRIPTION
If you have Gale with you before the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.
The cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a Thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.
With one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.

Gale Tries to Become a God
Ending Requirements and Conditions:

Play as Gale Origin
Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself

How to Obtain Ending:

Choose the good-natured ending
Let the cutscenes play out in the end



ENDING DESCRIPTION
In this ending, Gale will realize that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control of it for himself, and become a god.
However, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is seen reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:

I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all.
I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition.
I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.

Choose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.

### Gale Tips and Notes

* It used to be you needed to give extremely powerful artifacts to Gale to fuel his calm down the orb, but as of full release. An extremely long list of weaker artifacts can be now be given to him so this allows you not needing giving the strong artifacts that you actually use. 
  
I really recommend or any of the Absolute related Equipment like the Gloves of Power as it casts Bane to its user if they do not have the Mark of the Absolute. You get it pretty early but getting the mark of the Absolute is much more later so it is much more useful to give it to Gale to be consumed.

* Gale the Apothecary buildThis build focuses on using Ray of Sickness to it's full potential with poison synergies. Everything else is about rounding out Gale as a human spell caster. Use Feather Fall and Misty Step to keep Gale out of harm's way. Use Light to illuminate targets for those without Darkvision. 
  
Key of the Ancients
Poisoner's Robe
Herbalist's Gloves
Mystra's Grace
Staff of Crones (Infinite Ray of Sickness)

Anonymous17 Sep 2023 18:24  I romance Gale on my cleric (of Mystra, of all gods) and he is...quite okay. Commited, loyal, sweet talker. But as many of you noticed, he is...difficult. Poly with Halsin is out of the question.

If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2.

Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything.

I have the book, I have the gem to unlock it, I passed all the wisdom checks to unlock it and I still can't give it to him...anyone else know any reason why?ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit
Anonymous15 Oct 2020 22:16  I managed to get the Gale romance trigger today! Unsure how I did/why it triggered just yet but you can gain approval twice.It has to be at night/end of the day at camp. Talk to him (He'll have an exclamation point above him).1. Agree to have Gale teach you how to use magic/summon The Weave. (+1 Gale Approval)2. Imagine kissing him or imagine walking with him, holding hands. (+1 Gale approval if you choose one of these options)Unfortunately the romance scene is so buggy for most people at the moment but I hope this helps in the future! Let's go Gale romance!ReplyReplies (2)7+10-1 Submit

Poly with Halsin is out of the question. If you happen to have high approval with him, someone else, and choose that someone else to date, he will get pouty and salty - despite not initiating romance himself.In that regard, Astarion takes being friendzoned with dignity and grace for a changeBut he told me I'm better in bed than a literal goddess so that's a nice reward.

If you get the Mystra hologram scene and still have NOT talked to Lae'zel about eyeing you like a piece of meat. Attempting to romance him with either the kiss or the walk line effectively shuts down Lae'zel. If you have spoken to Lae'zel and desire to be her personal meat toy, you will NOT get that scene, additionally, Gale will not be a glimmer of a romance option. If you try to circumvent it by committing WHILE the scene is ready to go for Gale, and committing to Lae'zel, Gale will shut you down saying he is occupied. -- What it boils down to is... it's NOT Shadowheart and Lae'zel that are romance rivals, but rather, Gale and Lae'zel. Lae'zel also shuts you down if you sleep with Astarion first, but will NOT shut you down, if you commit to Lae'zel, and THEN sleep with Astarion. Gale... is... objectively the one that requires the MOST commitment. Surprisingly. If you deviate at any point while romancing Gale, his romance, effectively ends. Too bad I have no intention of being his rebound. TL:DR - If you intend to romance Gale, you MUST commit early, and STAY committed, all the way to the end.ReplyReplies (1)0+10-1 Submit

Turns out I initiated conversation with him thinking I had something he could eat. I did but nothing that I was willing to part with (I also had a bunch of things I was willing to part with but as stated, he is picky), so I had to run to the chest to fetch something but the only options given to get away from the interaction at that point are:1. Sure eat my best weapon go at it why would I not want the second lamest companion in the game to ruin my main character that's finally coming together.2. Flat persuade check (I will return I promise, I just need to walk to the other side of the camp).3. Something inconsequential4. I will never give you anything else ever again you magic fiend. I naturally thought he was going to leave if I did not give him anything and even if I wanted to, I could not save scum without losing massive progress. Wasted 4 inspiration rolls (that many-a-squirrel and bard had to die for) and in the end that junkie still didn't leave. I don't even think I lost approval. I dislike the concept of Gale personally but how the interaction is handled by itself is objectively bad writing.There should absolutely be a cystal clear option of "wait here, I'll be right back". In the future his hand will join me on adventures instead of him.ReplyReplies (2)2+122-1 Submit

 Submit Submit Submit* Anonymous25 Oct 2020 22:28  [SPOILERS AHEAD REGARDING COMPANION AFFECTION]I seen a few people wondering how to gain affection of certain characters, and for those of you interested in starting a love story with... Well, anyone, I thought you might find my experience interesting:Originally, I didn't mean to romance any character at all. Not because there is anything wrong with them in particular, but none of them really felt like a good fit for my ranger lady. Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything.

Astarion is cool and all, but his preference for "evil" choices made him a "nope" for this particular character's playthrough. Gale and Wyll just felt rather ... Ehm, not really into-the-wilds enough, so I just thought I'd ignore the entire affection-run entirely and simply roleplay my ranger and just deal with whatever negative/positives that comes along the way.So, all in all my ranger has a personality more suited for Wyll / Gale (meaning she's generally a "good" person, wanting so save innocents - but she dosn't hesitate to kill those she deem deserving of it). Most of my calls are neutral and I've had disapproves and approves coming in and out from all of my companions (I really thought I was pretty much on neutral ground at best with most of my followers). However, after defeating the goblin leaders, during the celebration in your camp - ALL 3 OF THE MALE CHARACTERS SHOWED ROMANTIC INTEREST AND WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT.I have not chosen any flirty options (that I am aware of) prior to this event - I did however let Astarion suck my blood on that one occasion, and then I asked him to stop at once. That's it. I even ignored my companions for most part, pretty much only speaking to them when they had the yellow " ! " above their head. Out of curiosity I accepted Astarions suggestions to spend the night - and the other two, Wyll and Gale, immediately expressed jealousy (literally out loud, but not in a immature way) when interacting with them afterwards (I interacted with ALL available NPCs during this evening just to see if there was any hidden conversations - the reason I talked to Astarion first is cause he had a " ! " above his head).So what do I want to say with this? Unless you're literally roleplaying a perfect-fit partner (or testing how much the affection scale matters) for a companion; just do your own characters roleplaying - you don't have to backtrack each time you see a "disapprove"-marker. It really does not appear to be very difficult to create a romantic relationship with a companion, even if your character and the companion don't see eye to eye on everything. (like I said, I've had negative and positive reactions from all of them)

I have the book, I have the gem to unlock it, I passed all the wisdom checks to unlock it and I still can't give it to him...anyone else know any reason why?ReplyReplies (1)4+10-1 Submit

Unsure how I did/why it triggered just yet but you can gain approval twice.It has to be at night/end of the day at camp. Talk to him (He'll have an exclamation point above him).1. Agree to have Gale teach you how to use magic/summon The Weave. (+1 Gale Approval)2. Imagine kissing him or imagine walking with him, holding hands. (+1 Gale approval if you choose one of these options)Unfortunately the romance scene is so buggy for most people at the moment but I hope this helps in the future! Let's go Gale romance!ReplyReplies (2)7+10-1 Submit
