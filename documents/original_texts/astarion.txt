# Astarion

Astarion is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3. BG3 Astarion can be met early in Act 1 while players explore the beach on the crash site of the Nautiloid. Astarion is a High-Elf Rogue, and a useful addition to your party thanks to his trickery skills. See The Pale Elf for Astarion's Questline.

As you explore the beach area, you will come across the destroyed Nautiloid wreck and can go through it and slightly up a hill. You'll find him there calling for help. See Astarion's Location on the BG3 Map.

To complete Astarion's Questline, you must first meet him in the south-west area of the Ravaged Beach in Act 1. He will be calling for help and ask that you deal with one of the brain monsters. This is actually a trap, and he will jump you from behind and hold a dagger to your neck if you aren't careful. You can shrug out of this with certain checks, but if you keep your cool everything will be fine and Astarion can join your party.
This will begin his quest:
- The Pale Elf

## HOW TO ROMANCE ASTARION

In this Astarion Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Astarion's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with him. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Astarion becomes available for romance when a certain point of approval has been reached. Astarion can be difficult to get high approval with due to his alignment toward less acceptable acts. He finds joy in cruelly mocking people and will root for Enemies sometimes, as he has a sort of kinship towards others who are labeled as monsters or malcontent, which might make it hard to avoid making decisions that he disapproves of as you go through the game and try to do good. That being said, he also places significant value on personal loyalty due to his context as a newly-freed slave. His approval is shaped by situations that reaffirm this principle, making it possible to earn his favor without resorting to malevolent actions.
As someone who delights in the misery of others and prioritizes his own survival and self-interest, Astarion will give his approval for actions that express selfishness and agreement to whatever he wants to do. In contrast, he will disapprove of kindness and generosity that won't derive any benefits. Having a silver tongue himself, he'll approve of decisions that lean toward theatrics and drama. He will also be the single Companion who is in favor of using and developing the tadpole powers, as they are essentially what made it possible for him to be freed from slavery by his former owner. As such, decisions that reflect this desire will gain his approval and he will in general be against pushing hard to remove the tadpole. Sympathizing with his situation will gain approval from him while judging him for his situation will push him away.

## ASTARION ROMANCE GUIDE ACT I
Your relationship with Astarion can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One way to gain good approval from him is to allow him to drink your blood whenever he needs a fix, and give it willingly.
You're on the right track with Astarion if when you talk to him, he forwardly calls you darling and says that you've been on his mind. Just choose the appropriate responses to further his confession - as long as you don't downright reject him, you'll have your chance. As with the others, he'll propose to wait until dark when the others are asleep before you meet up with him for your little rendevous. When night comes, simply sleep on your bed roll and he'll come for you. You don't have to worry about being forward in the dialogue options to follow and just keep affirming the situation to get to the intimate scene. As a bonus, you'll get to learn more about him afterward, specifically the markings on his back.

## ASTARION APPROVAL GUIDE
If you are looking to befriend or romance Astarion, you will have to get his approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.

General Personality Tips
- Astarion enjoys making fun of people, especially when it's cruel.
- He especially enjoys the suffering of others.
- Astarion will like good deeds if it is funny enough for his sense of humor (Like Rescue a Hostage victim and then Extort him or Help Karlach not because it is the right deed but in his words "Are you agreeing to commit murder for someone you barely know? Count me in." 
- Astarion values personal loyalty due to his circumstances. He gains approval from multiple events affirming this principle. This makes it possible to get him high approval without being evil.
- He is primarily concerned with his personal survival, Self-interest and ensured freedom against Cazador.
- The Tadpole nullified his Vampiric Banes (Running Water, Invitation indoors and damage from the Sun) and also broke the Mind control that Cazador held on him. Thus is extremely attached to it and the only companion (as of early access) who wants to continue to use the Tadpole's powers. Also the only companion that gains approval for dialogue that encourages its use.
- He hates playing as a hero and thus gains disapproval when the Player commits to heroic deeds.
- This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion.
- To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far enough away from the dialogue.

#### ENDING REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS:
Help Astarion with the ritual
See the ritual until the end

####HOW TO OBTAIN ENDING:
Provide help to Astarion when he asks for it
Agree to letting all of the spawns die to finish the ritual
Choose all the options that will allow the ritual to continue
ENDING DESCRIPTION

Once you have defeated Cazador inside his secret room, he will retreat to rest in his sarcophagus. Astarion will open his stone coffin and wake him up from his healing sleep. Astarion will now confront Cazador and the player will be faced with a choice. For this particular ending, we will be helping Astarion with the ritual. Astarion realizes that he can either kill Cazador to be free of him, or proceed with the ritual to turn himself into a Vampire Ascendant, and become more powerful. Astarion will then ask for your help and giving you the following choices:

All right, what do you need?
If I help you complete the ritual, it will kill all these people.
Didn't you hear him? If you complete the ritual, you'll be consumed.
I'm not doing this.
Choose the first option to help Astarion with the Ascension ritual. Then, Astarion will reveal his plan to put the same curse on Cazador by linking your minds together so he can see the scars that was placed on his back and copy them onto Cazador's body. Halsin will speak up and renounce Astarion's plan, saying that to sacrifice many, the 7,000 spawns, is an abomination. Astarion ignores Halsin and will plead out to you once more, asking for your help.

Enter Astarion's mind so he can proceed with the ritual.
No, we can't. I won't help you.
Choose the first option again. Then, Astarion can finally see the marks on his back and will begin to carve out the same mark on Cazador's back as he writhes in pain. The weakened Cazador drops down to his knees before Astarion, as Astarion grabs his staff. Astarion will now begin the Ascension ritual that will consume all of the spawns. During this ritual, Halsin will speak up once more to not let the ritual continue and you will get two choices:

Let the ritual continue.
Stop Astarion.
Choose the first one to allow Astarion to finish the ritual, but take note that you will receive Halsin and Shadowheart's disapprovals. As soon as the ritual is over, Astarion exclaims that he is finally free from hunger, at the cost of 7,000 spawns. Doing this will complete the quest: The Pale Elf, and Astarion will gain new abilities:

Ascendant Bite
Vampire Ascendant
Helping Astarion with the ritual will also give you a chance to loot Cazador's staff called Woe.

### REFUSE TO HELP ASTARION WITH THE ASCENSION RITUAL

#### ENDING REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS:
- Refuse to help Astarion with the ritual
- Reject his pleads

#### HOW TO OBTAIN ENDING:
Choose the dialogue options indicated below.

#### ENDING DESCRIPTION

As Astarion confronts Cazador, he will then ask for your help and give you the following choices:
- All right, what do you need?
- If I help you complete the ritual, it will kill all these people.
- Didn't you hear him? If you complete the ritual, you'll be consumed.
- I'm not doing this.

Choose the fourth one here but Astarion pleads once more, and tells you that he can't do it alone. You can reject him again and this will prompt Astarion go berserk and brutally murder Cazador. He drops to his knees as Cazador turns lifeless. This will result in Astarion leaving your party permanently, and the elf named Dalyria will approach Astarion, asking him if it's truly over.

Astarion will tell her that she can do whatever she wants, but for the spawns who are in the cages, they will share the same fate as Astarion. Meaning if he doesn't get freedom, then, they also won't get it. Astarion will then grab Cazador's staff and break it into two. Then Astarion will turn to face you, and be resentful for not getting the support he asked from you. This will result in Astarion permanently leaving your party.
