# WYRM'S LANDING & ASTRAL PLANE

## Quests
- Go to Bed
- Enter the portal to the Astral Plane
- Help Your Protector
- Embrace Your Potential
 
Heading down the road to Baldur's Gate from the Road to Baldur's Gate Waypoint west of the Moonrise Towers marks the beginning of Act III. There will be a series of cutscenes and when you get control back of your character, you will be at a campsite at the Wyrm's Landing. Head to bed when you're done and your sleep will be interrupted by a combat encounter with three Githyanki. This begins the Quest Help Your Protector. During this encounter, however, your goal isn't to defeat your three attackers, but to enter the portal ahead in three turns.

When you go through, you'll find yourself in the Astral Plane. Hop down to the platform below you and help the Intellect Devourers defeat the Githyanki warriors, then continue forward into the large skull. When you enter, you'll view a cutscene of a Mind Flayer fighting against several Githyanki. The Illithid will reveal that they were in fact your Dream Visitor and ask for help in defeating the Githyanki warriors. You'll have the following options when responding to it's request:
- What do you need me to do?
- Leave the githyanki alone!
- Prove to me that your are who you say.
- This is the battle you were fighting?
- I don't believe you. You're a mind flayer.
- Die, monster!

If you pick the fourth option, he will tell you that the warriors aim to free their master bound by chains and that you cannot let that happen. Agree, and you'll enter combat against four Githyanki warriors. After you defeat all four warriors the Mind Flayer, The Emperor, will thank you and explain that they are the reason you have not yet turned into a Mind Flayer yourself. You can learn more about them and the Astral Plane within the Artefact, after which they'll encourage you to embrace your illithid powers. You can respond with:
- I would like that.
- Why do you say that?
- I don't like what you're implying...
- I'm trying to avoid becoming a mind flayer - I thought you agreed to protect me.

Pick the second option and he offers to evolve the tadpole in your head to the next stage, enhancing your Illithid Powers in exchange for a slight change in appearance. You can freely ask him why he can't stop ceremorphosis, after which you'll have to agree or disagree to his offer. If you disagree, he understands and hopes you can defeat your foes without the need of enhanced Illithid abilities, but gives you the Astral-Touched Tadpole just in case you change your mind. This conversation will be noted in the Embrace Your Potential Personal Quest, and ends Help Your Protector.

After the conversation ends, you can explore the Astral Plane freely and go back to loot the bodies of the defeated Githyanki warriors. Some Items of note include the Boots of Uninhibited Kushigo on Prelate Lir'i'c and a rare Scroll of Disintegrate on a Dead Githyanki northeast of the exit portal. When you're done in the Astral Plane, use the portal to return to your campsite at Wyrm's Lookout. The Personal Quest Free Orpheus will begin when you leave. Go to bed, for real this time, and when you exit the campsite, you'll be on the road to Rivington.

Upon reaching Rivington at (X:-13 Y:-114), you'll witness an ongoing argument between Ben Golewits and other NPCs at (X:9 Y:-98). You can step in using the following dialogue options:

- You certainly know how to make people feel welcome.
- Does no one we meet ever get along?
- The army of the absolute is mere days away and you're bickering over property ownership?

Opt for the first choice, and Arfur Gregorio will explain his desire to remove trespassers from his property. You can reply with:
- This is a pretty big house - are you sure you don't have a single spare room?
- It's always heartening to see a true philanthropist out in the wild.
- Squatters, is it? Maybe I'd be willing to lend a helping hand.
- [Detect Thoughts] Probe his thoughts.
- Leave.

Select the first option, and Ben Golewits will agree. However, Arfur's disagreement escalates into racial slurs. Karlach becomes angry, and Arfur threatens them to leave or face consequences. Respond with:
- In that case, perhaps I can help you out.
- [Intimidation] Let them stay or I'll make you leave and never come back.
- Well, good luck with that.

Choose the second option, and if your charisma is sufficient, you'll intimidate Arfur into allowing them to stay. Zenovia Dawg will then express skepticism, revealing her connection to a criminal group called the Guild. You can reply with:
- All right, I get it - how much do you want?
- Or what?
- Over my dead body.

Opt for the second choice, and Zenovia will reiterate her threat. Respond with:
- [Intimidation] I fought and killed an avatar of Myrkul recently. I think I can handle you.
- All right - how much do you want?
- [Melee Attack] Stand down.
- [Intimidation] I could give you that gold - but then I'd just take it back after I killed you.
- Let's find out shall we?

Choose the first option, and with enough charisma, you'll startle Zenovia. She abandons her intention to rob you and departs. Proceed to enter Arfur's mansion and speak to Ben. Thank him for standing up for them, and reply with:
- You're welcome.
- And you'd better be grateful for it.
- How did you end up here?
- Leave.

Select the first option, and Ben will express his gratitude as you become the first to support them. Exit the mansion, head a little North East, and observe Baldurians and Saer Grotpoll arguing with a guard named Fist Lochan. Saer addresses you as another visitor taking space. Respond with:
- [Baldurian] Baldur's Gate is the most diverse city in all of Faerun. We should take them in with pride.
- Refugees aren't strays. They are people, and they need help.
- [Baldurian] I'll have you know I was born and bred in Baldur's Gate.
- [Baldurian] Baldurian? Your accent's Rivingtonian - that hardly counts.
- I should be leaving.

Choose the fourth option, and Saer will be offended. At X:102 Y:-111, you'll encounter Rowan, a guard, who greets you and inquires if this is your first visit to Baldur's Gate. You can respond in the following ways:
- [Baldurian] No, I'm from Baldur's Gate, born and bred. It's great to be back.
- [Baldurian] Do I look like a tourist? I live here.
- My past is private.
- Do you get extra pay for being so cheerful?

Opt for the first choice, and Rowan recounts the city's history, once known for its welcoming nature but now strained due to recent events. Respond with:
- It's not surprising. Tensions seem high.
- I didn't come here seeking assistance. I can manage on my own.
- I know ways to encourage sharing.
- Is there a way to alleviate people's burden?
- It sounds like your problem, not mine.

Select the first choice, and Rowan explains the refugee situation's challenges. Respond with:
- People in this city have become self-centered. They need a reminder of true hardship.
- If refugees possess more than they require, it's only fair they contribute.
- Educating them could be beneficial, given their lack of understanding.
- Your duty is to maintain peace, not escalate conflicts.
- Your uniform should suffice to pacify them.

Choose the fourth option, and Rowan conveys his concern that if no action is taken, more casualties will accumulate. He believes refugees have taken advantage of the city for too long. He'll ask if you'd join him in eliminating the refugees. Respond with:
- They're innocent people. You can't simply kill them!
- Both sides could benefit from a lesson: Let's address the issue comprehensively.
- You're monstrous. I'll report you to your superiors.

Opt for the third choice, and Rowan issues violent threats. He then morphs into Orin, conveying a message for Gortash and asserting her vigilant presence before vanishing. This action propels the main quest "Get Orin's Netherstone." Proceed to a Windmill at X:47 Y:-29. Once there, unlock the door and enter. Approach the prone Mind Flayer inside and interact with it using different responses:
- Express skepticism about its fortune.
- [Great Old One] Establish a mental connection with this fledgling aberration - awaken it.
- Launch an attack on the creature before it regains consciousness.
- [Stealth] Quietly retreat.

Opt for the first choice, and you'll find that the Emperor's voice resonates in your mind, asserting that the situation is indeed fortunate. The Emperor clarifies that the Mind Flayer has recently undergone a transformation, rendering it weakened and ripe for potential harvesting. The Emperor tasks you with killing the creature and absorbing its power. In response, you can reply:
- [Great Old One] Establish a mental connection with this fledgling aberration - awaken it.
- Attack the creature before it wakes up.
- [Stealth] Slip away unnoticed.

Choose the second option, which results in the Mind Flayer abruptly awakening in a startled state. This sudden awakening triggers a fierce battle between you and the Mind Flayer. Following a victorious outcome in the battle, search the creature's body for valuable items, including the Mind Flayer Brain and a Windmill Key. With these newfound acquisitions, you're now able to depart from the Windmill, continuing your journey ahead. Head to X:-94 Y:109 to uncover a chest on a shattered ship, from which you can retrieve the Necklace of Elemental Augmentation. Proceed southwestward until reaching X:-140 Y:71, where two mortally wounded Stonelord Thugs await. Engage in conversation with one of them, under the mistaken belief that your presence signals the end of their journey. Your responses can include:
- Who are you?
- What led to your current state?
- Accusing innocent passers-by – an intriguing survival tactic.
- With pleasure.

Opt for the second choice, and the thug will acknowledge their unfortunate choice of conflict. He'll seek assistance for his injuries, prompting potential responses:
- Attempt to heal him.
- What task would you have me perform?
- You're beyond salvation. My apologies.
- Provoke his wound, assessing his pain.

Choosing the first option, the thug will prevent your aid, deeming it too late. He'll brandish a blade, requesting a swift end to his agony. Your responses here can be:
- I'll accompany you till the end, but I won't hasten your departure.
- I'll expedite the process – a painless passage.
- Inflict a grievous wound, inciting suffering and screams.
- No. I won't bear your blood on my hands.

Choose the second option to see your character swiftly end the thug's life. But a surprising twist occurs – the thug morphs into Orin. She discloses that Gortash expects you and advises vigilance against his manipulation. She vanishes once more, leaving you with a sense of her manipulative play. Afterward, venture along the coast to X:-199 Y:96. An argument brews between Cairos and Farlin, Stone Lord and Guild representatives. Farlin seeks your assistance, promising rewards. Your possible responses:
- The prospect of rewards appeals – I'm in.
- The Stone Lord seems a better choice.
- I'd rather abstain from this.
- I might just eliminate you both and claim the spoils.
- Can't we find common ground? Must conflict be the only recourse?

Opt for the first choice, prompting Cairos to mock your allegiance. Battle ensues, and afterward, you can converse with the fallen. Speak with Farlin if he falls:
- Who are you?
- Who were your adversaries?
- Their purpose for being here?
- Your reason for being here?

Select the third choice, and Farlin reveals they sought their share for Nine-Fingers. Inquire about the Stone Lord's identity, and Farlin portrays the Stone Lord as a perilous menace to all.

After exploring the coast around Rivington, there are a few places within the town itself you can visit to start, progress and complete several Side Quests before making your way towards Baldur's Gate. In the north part of the town, opposite to the Open Hand Temple, is the Sword Coast Couriers. During Act 1, if you found Scratch and Gomwick in the north part of the Forest, you can bring up Gomwick's demise to the person in charge. Speak to the man behind the counter, Danzo Arkwright, and you'll be able to give him the Personal Note and let him know about Gomwick. He'll then explain that with Gomwick gone, he's been attempting to send letters by pigeons, but these pigeons have been getting attacked as well. This will start the Find the Missing Letters Quest. If you found and confronted the Tressym on top of the Open Hand Temple earlier, you'll be rewarded immediately after the conversation ends.

On the desk Danzo is standing behind is one white poster that you will not get in trouble for reading - Gortash Coronation Poster. If you read it, you'll learn that Gortash is being named an Archduke and that the ceremony will take place at Wyrm's Rock. Get Gortash's Netherstone and Our Fiery Friend will be updated with this information.

Out the Double Doors to the right of the building are the courier's dog trainers and their several dogs in cages. Scratch was one of their courier dogs and you can mention him when speaking to the dogs' caretakers. During the conversation, you can choose whether to keep Scratch at Camp, or surrender him back to the Sword Coast Couriers. If you keep him, you can speak to him back at camp to learn that he's glad you kept him. Keeping Scratch at camp gives you the approval of both Wyll and Gale.

South of the Sword Coast Couriers and northwest of Artur's Mansion, you'll find a blacksmith, The Rivington General. If you head up the stairs and speak to Gyldro Angleiron the Smith, he's irritable and points you towards the store downstairs if you want to buy anything. You'll find the door to the store behind the blacksmith. Head downstairs to find the store's clerk, Exxvikyap. If you're a Dragonborn, you'll have some special dialogue choices with her. This merchant sells several weapons, pieces of armour and arrows.

Exit the blacksmith an in the western part of Rivington, south of the Open Hand Temple, is the Circus of the Last Days. You can approach Klaus at the entrance to gain passage to the circus. You'll be given a variety of checks you can choose from to gain access to the circus - Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation.

Straight ahead, you'll find two circus members - Zara the Mummy and Akabi. Zara is a Merchant who sells Dyes and face paint kits, but you'll have to do a DC 10 Insight Check first when speaking to her to understand that she's trying to sell you something. Akabi, on the other hand, will encourage you to try spinning the Wheel of Wonders next to him. Each try on the wheel costs 500 Gold.

Down the stairs to the right side of the circus. you'll find the dryad Zethino. If you're in a relationship with anyone, she'll ask if you're in love when you speak to her, to which you can answer yes and bring your love one to her. This will begin a love test of sorts, where you'll have to answer three questions about your loved one to gauge how well you truly know them. If you answer all three questions correctly, you'll have a brief but cute conversation with your loved one, and they will gain Inspiration.

In the southwestern tent of the Circus of the Last Days, you'll find Boney and Stoney. You can have a statue of yourself sent to Camp for a fee of 5000 Gold. Boney is also available as a merchant, selling you some Scrolls and a variety of Gems if you need them. Popper, another merchant, can be found in a tent right next to Stoney. He sells the Dark Displacement Gloves and Arrow of Arcane Interference, as well as several potions. Within his tent is the Clown's Severed Hand for the Find Dribbles the Clown Quest.

Head down the stairs and to the north, and you'll find Shadow-Whiskers trapped in a cage. If you cast Speak with Animals, you'll be able to understand her. Pass several checks and she'll reveal that she plans on slaughtering everyone within the circus for stealing her cubs and killing her mate. When you approach the nearby crowd she plans on slaughtering, you will get pulled into a cutscene with Dribbles the Clown. 

This cutscene can go several ways, but always ends in a combat encounter. After the fight, you can loot Fuum, previously Dribbles, for the Word from the Tribunal and Clown Hammer. Lucretious will also approach the area from her tent. She'll be upset that Dribbles turned out to be a doppelganger and will ask you to help her find the real one. If you agree to help her, the Find Dribbles the Clown Quest will begin.

I'm just here to have a drink.
Unfortunately, yes - I've discovered new evidence, Investigator.
She asked me to uncover Lorgan's true murderer, given your apparent disinterest.
Leave.
Choose the third option, prompting her to notice your expression and liken you to her associate, Devella. She inquires about your findings, and you can reveal your conclusion that Father Lorgan's death is linked to a larger plot involving Bhaal. Valeria is surprised, as Devella is investigating a similar Bhaal-related matter. Present your theory, the Murder Target List, which confirms your belief. Valeria suggests you meet Devella at the Elfsong Tavern, providing a pass for Lower City access. This advances the "Investigate the Murders" Main quest.

As you head inside the fortress, you will immediately notice the stony structure and statues on the walls. There are guards stationed along the hallway and upon noticing your presence, a Steel Watcher will ask you to stop to tell you that Lord Gortash has been expecting you. After a short while, the watcher seems to pause and begins to speak with a different tone and poise. It is now speaking to you as 'Lord Enver Gortash'. He recognizes you as the Prism bearer and slayer of Ketheric Thorm. He welcomes you to Baldur's Gate and calls it 'his city' You will now get the following options to respond:
- This city will never be yours.
- A pleasure to meet you. Could we talk face-to-face?
- I'm going to find you, and I'm going to kill you.
- Attack.

If you choose the first one, he replies that it's already his but continues to invite you to go inside and see the city for yourself.  He formally invites you to his inauguration which will take place in the ceremonial hall. Now that you have a formal invite from Gortash, you shouldn't have more trouble with the guards. 

If you have Karlach as one of your companions, approach one of the steel watchers stationed along the hallway and you will find out that it recognizes her as one of them. The steel watcher continues to share that her 'unit' is a highly outdated model and will ask her to report to the Steel Watch Foundry. You will now get the following options to respond:
- It thinks you're one of them, Karlach. Why?
- Same thing Dammon said. Do you know how to fix this malfunctioning engine?
- Where is this Steel Watch Foundry?
- Leave.

The steel watcher will continue to tell you that the foundry is off-limits to visitors and though Karlach is not sure why it thinks she's one of them, she believes that what keeps them going may be similar to her tin can. When you are done with the conversation, enter the door to your left to reach the audience hall. A familiar face is seen here, Mizora, if you helped her escape in Mind Flayer Colony.

She tells you that Wyll is upstairs and ordaining Gortash as Archduke. Explore the Audience Hall and you will find that many of these people are busy and will not stop for a conversation. There is one lever found in a small corner at exactly (X:-40 Y:218) This lever will reveal a door that will lead outside to let you explore the side of the fortress to grab some plants and Dragon Egg mushrooms. You will also find a locked chest at (X:60 Y:214 pictured below, near the coast with an abandoned boat. To unlock this chest, you will need to do a Dexterity Check with a DC of 15

You can now continue to go around the fortress and it should take you to the opposite side. Climb up a wooden platform and you can interact with the Knotted Roots that will take you back to the fortress on a balcony. The door will require you to pass a Dexterity check with a DC of 20. As you reach the hallway, you will find 2 Double Doors that will lead to the ceremonial hall where Gortash will be inaugurated. 

As you get closer to the ceremony, a Steel Watcher will stop you from moving forward. You will get the next options to respond:

Point taken. I'll keep things peaceful.
I'm not taking orders from a piece of metal.
Prepare for battle.
If you choose the first one, the steel watcher will thank you for your cooperation and Astarion will give you his approval. In a short moment, Gortash will notice what's happening and turn his attention to you. He will greet and congratulate you for defeating Ketheric Thorm and then mentions the Netherstone that you acquired from him. He continues that it has become more difficult to have the elder brain under control because of the Netherstone that you are holding. He is worried about what will become of Faerun, should the elder brain be free from the crown. He wants to restore authority over the brain and you will get the following options to respond:

What kind of understanding do you suggest?
I'm not interested in bargaining with the likes of you.
Why is the crown failing?
You're a dead man. I can't let you take over the city.
If you choose the first one, you find out that Orin has been planning something of her own. As Bhaal's chosen, she wants to control all Netherstones for her lord. Gortash disapproves of this and he tells you that he wants to lead the city to glory. Gortash expresses also that Orin is interested in obtaining his and your blood. You will now get the following options to respond:

What do you propose?
You want me to believe you mean no harm to the city?
It's going to take a lot to make me trust you.
If you choose the second one, he will tell you that he wants to propose a pact, that no harm will be done to you by him, and him to you.  Then, he continues to tell you to retrieve Orin's Netherstone and bring it back to Gortash. The other stone is yours to keep, but the goal is to reunite all 3 stones. He offers to rule Faerun together as the Absolute. Your next set of choices will look like this:

As allies, it seems none of you can be trusted. You, Orin, Ketheric.
I will defeat Orin and we shall be allies. You have my oath.
I'll think about it. No promises.
To the hells with your pact.
[INSIGHT] Examine Gortash's body language and expressions. Can you trust him?
[DETECT THOUGHTS] Probe Gortash's mind.
Attempting the Insight check will require you to pass a DC of 15. It will be revealed that he has the full intention of sharing the kingdom with you. Then, you will have the following options to respond to Gortash:

As allies, it seems none of you can be trusted. You, Orin, Ketheric.
I will defeat Orin and we shall be allies. You have my oath.
I'll think about it. No promises.
To the hells with your pact.
If you choose the third one, Gortash will reveal that there is one faceless among your camp. Orin is known to change her form quickly and may prove to be difficult to manage. He offers to help investigate in order to reveal the faceless. Then, he invites you to witness as he makes history as the first Archduke of Baldur's Gate. You will get the following options to respond:

All right.
I wouldn't dream of missing it.
Fine. Let's get it over with.
I have no interest in this sham of a ceremony.
This stops now Gortash. I'm taking you out.
If you choose the second one, Karlach will give you her disapproval while Astarion gives his approval. Then, Gortash kneels before Duke Ulder Ravengard and proceeds with the ceremony. After the Duke is done with his words, he will now ask the guests for consent and you will have the following options to respond:

Say nothing.
Nod.
Prepare to object.
If you choose the first one, Gortash will now be appointed as the Archduke of Baldur's Gate. When the ceremony is over, Karlach will speak to you about how you let Gortash become Archduke, and will ask what you think of him:

He seemed like an absolute fraud in a very nice coat.
Frankly, I'm impressed. He's wormed his way into the most powerful position in Baldur's Gate.
I can't wait to flatten him.
If you choose the first one, Karlach will give you her approval and agrees that he has always had an expensive taste. She continues to ask how anyone in the hall could fall for this charade:

Evidently not.
When people are scared, they'll do whatever it takes to feel safe.
People are mostly fools.
Choosing the second here will anger Karlach even further and wished that people knew the truth about the Dead Three being behind all of this. She wants the people to know that Gortash isn't their salvation but the very monster at the gate. The rest of the audience leaves the hall but Duke Ulder Ravengard remains and gives you a chance at a conversation. If you tell this man that he is infected with an Illithid parasite, Astarion will approve of this.

Ravengard appears to be fighting the parasite but the control over him is strong. You get the option to use your Illithid powers to explore his uncertainty. If you attempt the Wisdom check, you will need to pass a DC of 2. Then, you can now look around the fortress. You will find Mizora on the first floor back in the Audience Hall. She has more things to tell you about the condition of Ravengard. She reveals that he has been relocated and will only tell you in camp, once you have Wyll in your party. This will update Rescue the Grand Duke quest.

 

WYRM'S ROCK PRISON
To explore the Prison, return to the door that will take you outside. There's a crack in the wall that you can interact with at exactly (X:58 Y:189). Once inside, jump over the ledge to reach the walls of the prison. Destroy this wall with one of your attacks to gain entry to one of the storage rooms. There's a chest inside so make sure to take a look before unlocking the door. Unlocking the door will require you to do a Dexterity Check with a DC of 15.

Be careful when opening the door because a Prison Guard is likely to spot you. When this happens, you can attempt a Deception check or attack. Doing the former will require passing a DC of 15. If you're successful, there's no need to attack the guard as he will simply let you through. Continue on the path the guard is facing to reach the Prison Entrance Door. Since you don't have the key, you will need to unlock this door by lockpicking by doing a Dexterity Check which requires a DC of 20. You may also choose to fight the guards and obtain the key from them.

You will find a guard sleeping to your left upon unlocking the door. Try not to make any sound to avoid waking them up, or put them under a spell to guarantee that they will stay asleep. This passage will lead you back to the Fortress where the others are waiting.

This will update the main quest "Investigate the Murders" under the "Get Orin's Netherstone" section, as well as a side quest titled "Kill the Rats." Proceed to the Elfsong Tavern Basement, where you'll encounter numerous rats to eliminate. After exterminating them, both the "Roveer's Storehouse" and "Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout" quests will receive updates. Enter the secret Wine Passage in the basement to reach the old Hideput of the emperor. 

From the Emperor's Hideout, access the Lower City Sewers through the hatch. There, you'll encounter a bloodied Gale who warns you to distance yourself from a particular "monster." Reply with:
- What monster are you referring to?

- Why are you here in the sewers?
- Whatever you're running from, it poses no threat to me.

Select the first option to learn that Gale was abducted by Orin the Red and held captive in her Bhaalist temple. He reveals the temple is situated within the sewers and that Orin subjected him to terrible experiences. Gale urges you to run since Orin is formidable. Respond with:

- I'm not leaving you behind.
- You won't face her alone. We'll confront her together.
- Gale, what did she do to you exactly?

Opt for the fourth option, which reveals Gale's peculiar reaction and leads to his transformation into Orin herself. Confronted by Orin, she questions your presence in the sewers and assumes you're after her Netherstone. She also mocks your concern for Gale. Respond with:
- What happened to Gale?
- You're welcome to him; I could use some peace and quiet.
- Gortash warned me that you might try something like this.
- You'll pay for this, monster.
- Prepare to defend yourself.

Choose the third option, and Orin will mention Gortash, hinting at her knowledge of him. She refers to your interaction with him and claims that the Murder Lord also desires you. Reply with:
- Why does the Murder Lord want me? What's his motive?
- If you come for me, you'll meet your god soon enough.
- The voice you hear isn't divine; it's a product of your twisted mind.
- It seems everyone wants a piece of me. He'll have to wait his turn.

Select the first option, and Orin will mention Ketheric's Killer. She indicates that before you can challenge her, you need to sharpen your skills against a different foe—the Tyrant's Throat. Orin then shifts into Gortash's form, claiming to see his whispers and promises in your thoughts. She explains his desire for the Crown of Karsus, wanting it for himself. Orin expresses her urge to eliminate Gortash but reveals she can't touch him since he bound her blade during their initial encounter. She proposes you kill Gortash, retrieve the Netherstone from his body, and bring it to her temple. After reverting to her true form, she offers to bring her assassins under control if you agree; otherwise, she threatens harm to Gale. Respond with:
- So you're betraying your ally? Or are you asking me to?
- Very well. I'll kill Gortash. Gale will live. After that, we settle things for the final Netherstone.
- Gortash can wait. First, I'm confronting you, monster.
- I'll comply. Just promise not to harm Gale.

Choose the first option, leading Orin to explain that they aren't allies, just two forces in balance. Then inquire about Gortash's whispers, and she'll confirm that she sees them. She adds that Bhaal's age is drawing near and insinuates that you could be part of it—an idol of flesh to welcome the coming dawn of his bloody reign. Orin warns not to underestimate the Steel Watch and threatens to harm Gale if she sees you in her domain while Gortash remains alive. Then, she disappears. This conversation updates the quests "Disable the Steel Watch", "Get Orin's Netherstone", and "Rescue Orin's Victim".

After your conversation with Orin, return to the Elfsong Tavern and proceed to the staircase leading to the tavern's second floor. Ascend the stairs and enter the door ahead. A cutscene will unfold, showing Devella at the crime scene. While she's frustrated someone let you through, she asks why you're interrupting her. Reply with:
- Are you Devella? Valeria sent me to assist.
- I'm just a curious adventurer, interested in the scene.
- I'm no one important, just passing through.
- Your anger is quite palpable. I'll leave you be.
- I seem lost. I'll find my way out.

Select the first option. Devella will reluctantly confirm her identity. She'll express that if you lack helpful information, you should leave her to her work, as she's investigating Duke Stelmane's murder. Reply with:
- Share about the murder target list you found.
- Is it possible the murderer was tied to the Bhaal cult?
- With Bhaal's involvement, more is at stake than Stelmane's death.
- Best of luck with your investigation.

Opt for the first choice. Devella will be intrigued by your information, updating the Main Quest "Investigate the Murders." She'll elaborate that her assignment led her in the same direction, but she hadn't expected these developments. She explains that a century ago, Sarevok Anchev, Bhaal's son, ruled the Iron Throne, which masked a dark arms-dealing network. Sarevok aimed to ascend to godhood by amassing an army, leading to the revival of Bhaal's temple and cult. Although the temple was destroyed, the cult's remnants persisted, ultimately evidenced by the murder list. Devella concludes that the Bhaal cult has resurfaced, and someone is continuing Sarevok's sinister legacy. Respond with:
- Why don't you think it's Sarevok himself?
- Do you have any suspicions about who might be behind this?
- But Sarevok led the cultists a century ago; he can't still be alive, can he?
- I share your concerns. I've noticed an uptick in Bhaalist activity myself.
- You should inform your superiors about this immediately.

Opt for the first option. Devella is skeptical that Sarevok is involved, noting differences in the recent murders that suggest they're acts of worship. She explains she tried informing her superiors, but they dismissed it as conspiracy. She turns her attention to you, hoping for assistance. Reply with:
- Can't you provide any assistance?
- What will you do while I investigate?
- How about the other individuals on the list who are still alive?
- I'll do my best to uncover the truth.
- I've got more important matters to attend to than a cult investigation.

Select the first two options. Devella states she needs to alert Upper City residents and asks you to warn those on the list in the Lower City. After Upper City, she'll head to Basilisk Gate to push her superiors for action. She invites you to meet her there once you have any relevant information to report. This conversation advances the "Investigate the Murders" quest.

After conversing with Devella, descend to the tavern's second floor and exit. Make your way westward until you arrive at the Wine Festival located at X:25 Y:-38. There, you'll encounter Cora Highberry, who's enjoying the wine tasting. She invites you to join her and her friend Roger Highberry. However, Meztli interrupts, offering a solo tasting to Cora. She declines, preferring company. You sense the poison in Meztli's offered wine. Choose:
- Cora, that wine is poisonous. This man wants to harm you.
- I'll gladly take a glass, Master Meztli.
- I'll have to pass, but enjoy your wine.
- Let Master Meztli try the wine first, or should I say Dolor?
- Attack the poisoner.

Opt for the first choice. Meztli speaks briefly and threatens you before a battle ensues. Afterward, the Main Quest "Investigate the Murders" will be updated. Enter the Highberry's Home nearby to speak with Cora. She'll express gratitude for your intervention and disbelief at the assassination attempt.

Having conversed with Cora and received a reward, head southwest until you arrive at Facemaker's Boutique at X:-182 Y:-32. As you enter, a cutscene unfolds, depicting Dolor attacking Devella and her superior, leaving them immobilized. Overhearing Dolor mention a gift for Lord Bhaal, you can react with:
- Halt!
- Step back. That's my target.
- [Stealth] Remain concealed as the dwarf is distracted.

Choose the first option (Astarion Disapproves), prompting Dolor to acknowledge a challenger and triggering another battle. After defeating Dolor, the quest "Investigate the Murders" is updated. Once the enemies are vanquished, Devella expresses gratitude for your rescue. She explains that Doppelgangers ambushed them, paralyzing them before they could retaliate. Respond with:
- Weren't you responsible for safeguarding the patriarchs in the upper city?
- These doppelgangers appear to be monitoring his advancement. This one seems to be gaining prominence among Bhaalists.
- Fortunately, I was here to assist.
- It's regrettable. I assume you're swamped with paperwork. I'll leave you to it.

Select the first option, and Devella elaborates that she heard a disturbance while en route to the upper city. She believes these killings are part of a trial, detailing that the document you shared outlines the test. Victims are paralyzed, offered to Bhaal, and framed as the work of the Cult of Absolute. This provides access to a "Tribunal," an initiation for aspiring cultists to demonstrate their dedication. This initiation occurs beneath 'Canduhallow's Tombstones'. However, due to her constraints, she defers the investigation to you. Reply with:
- I should probably seek out a hand, then.
- Can you pinpoint the location of 'Candulhallow's Tombstones'?
- It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. I'll handle this.
- I'll look into it.

Choose the fourth option. Devella plans to head to the upper city, meeting you at Basilisk Gate later. Lastly, loot Dolor's body and acquire the "Hand Bag," updating the Main Quest "Impress the Murder Tribunal."


# DEVIL'S FEE

Return to the Graveyard when you are done exploring the Mausoleum by interacting with the door that you came through and head to the Devil's Fee at (X:-35 Y:-11). You will see a tall building surrounded by a wrought iron fence with flowers crawling over it. Head inside the building and you will notice the floor is decorated with red carpets, bookshelves lining the walls, and a wide range of monster skulls are proudly displayed both on tables and on the walls. Interact with these items that you see and upon closer examination, it appears that these items are genuine infernal collections.

In the middle of the building, there's a trader called Helsik. Speak with her and she will show you her items like dyes, oils, and other items. However, she has more items to sell to you but first, you need to explore and take a closer look at the building. You will see there's a floor above the trader and you can access this by going through the stairs on the right of the trader. Be careful as you reach the top of the stairs as there is a trap waiting for trespassers.

For now, return to the lobby and examine the decorations that you will see. Return to Helsik once more and compliment her collection of items. She will appreciate this and will now show you her rare collection including Gemini Gloves, Cloak of the Weave, Shapeshifter Hat, and others. She claims that this is her more curated collection and she's willing to sell it to you.

Speak with Halsik once more to ask her if she can grant us access to Raphael's House of Hope. She welcomes you back to her store and you will get the following options to respond:
- Curious don't interest me. I'm interested in the hells themselves- a place called the House of Hope in particular.
- Did you help Lord Gortash retrieve some hellish curious by any chance?
- Show me your wares. The good stuff.
- Leave.

If you choose the second one, she will suspect that you are familiar with the Archduke to know a private matter such as that. You will get the next choices:
- I happened upon some of his correspondence that mentioned your dealings with him.
- We're old colleagues.
- We were lovers. It was all very steamy,
- I'm asking the questions here.

If you choose the second one, she will respond that she likes to deal with remarkable people. She will now ask for an offer to help you with the answers you seek. She servers Lord Mammon and he is asking for coin. 

NOTE: Some choices may be different depending on your character's class, race, and other specifics.
- Toss a coin to the diabolist.
- Here's 100 gold.
- How about 1000 gold?
- Actually, I'll just take a look at your usual wares, if you don't mind.
- [WARLOCK][PERSUASION] I'm also of the pact-bound persuasion- don't suppose I can have a free sample?

If you choose the 5th one, she will happily oblige to give you info for free. Attempting the Persuasion check will require you to pass a DC of 10. Astarion will also give you his approval. She tells you that she's known as the Latchkeeper of the Nine Hells and she can break people into the Hells and also shares that she opened a portal for Lord Gortash. Your next set of choices will look like this:
- Where in the hells did the portal go?
- What business did Gortash have in the Hells?
- Raphael told me the Crown of Karsus was stolen from Mephistopheles- were you involved with that?

If you choose the 3rd one she will ask for more coin for information. She acknowledges that the Crown of Karsus has left the vault, and an opportunity opened for a devil named Raphael. He also collects a great deal of treasures in his House of Hope and the crown is what he's lacking. Now, you will get the next choices:
- Can you help me break into the House of Hope?
- Well, that was interesting but I'd just like to see your wares.
- That information wasn't worth what I paid.
- Leave.

If you choose the first one, she tells you that it is a ludicrous task and will require a substantial donation to Lord Mammon's coffers amounting to 20,000, you can try to bargain with her by attempting a Persuasion check to lower the price to 10,000. This will require you to pass a DC of  25. You can agree to pay her or come back when you are ready to pay the fee.

Before moving to your next destination, make sure to drop by Bonecloak's Apothecary. If you helped Derryth and her husband in the Underdark, their store will still be running, thanks to you. She sells elixirs and some equipment. When you're done, head to the Lodge which can be found at (X:-217 Y:78), and interact with the double doors to go inside. 

# HELP OMELUUM QUEST

Use the stairs on the right of the building where you will find Blurg in one of the rooms. Blurg is a friend of Omeluum, whom you met while on your journey in the Underdark. Blurg appears to be worried about Omeluum since he hasn't heard from him, who went on an investigation about your tadpole's condition. Remember to ask Blurg if he has anything to trade, as he also sells items in Lower City. Agreeing to help Blurg will give you a new quest: Retrieve Omeluum.

Your current quest will lead you to investigate the basement of Jannath's Estate. Upon reaching the entrance of her estate, a butler will greet you to tell you that she is not able to welcome any guests at the moment. This will prompt you to look for other entrances through the Gardener's Basement at (X:-251 Y:-86) this is found just below where you talked to the Butler named Tarhun Mnemonis. The door says 'Keep Out' but it is not locked at all so you can just walk inside.

Next, look at the corners of the room and you will notice a plate with a rectangular shape on the floor and an arch on the wall. Have two of your party members stand on each plate to reveal the door in the middle of the room. You will also need to move the wooden crates to pass through, be careful as you go inside because there is a trap just by the door that will explode if you can't disarm it. Next, interact with the Ornate Wooden Hatch to reach the Abandoned Cistern, a sub-area in the City Sewers.

Beware of this area as you will find many Bhaalists down here and they are hostile on contact. The good thing here is that upon arriving at the location, you will stand on a tall platform which gives you an advantage over your enemies. When you are done fighting them, make sure to look around and retrieve items from the chests and the bodies of your enemies before proceeding to the next location.

# GREY HARBOUR DOCKS AND WATER QUEEN'S DOCKS

Next, leave this area to continue your search for Omeluum and return to the Lower City. In Grey Harbour Docks at exactly (X:-226 Y:-147), you will find a familiar face that needs rescuing. Volo is seen captured by bandits led by Churg Elvek. They are calling Volo a fearmonger, an agent of chaos. Astarion speaks up to get him out of distress and you will get the following options to respond:
- Volo has done nothing wrong- you, on the other hand, serve the Absolute.
- Ready your weapon.
- What crime is this man guilty of? If he is guilty, where's the evidence? Where's the trial? This isn't justice- this is mob madness!
- Well, go on then. Do whatever it is you're planning to do to him.

If you choose the first option, Churg Elvek will claim that your mind has been clouded by the disruptor's lies and will engage your party in a battle. You will be outnumbered in this location as there are 7 enemies, but not to worry, if your party is well-equipped and if you plan your moves right, you will come out of this battle victorious. Volo is still tied on crates along the rails so make sure to reach him quickly and use 'Help' to free him. Volo will thank you once again for helping him and this event will inspire Astarion 'Saving a Fellow Tale-Spinner'.

Continue exploring South of Grey Harbour Docks to reach the Water Queen's Docks. One of their members will greet you at the entrance to carry a certain 'Holli' to her final rest in the Deep Wilds. However, she notices your confusion and asks if you are visiting for the Waveservant Holli's funeral. Now, you will get the following options to respond:
- Is that what that singing is for?
- Am I interrupting the funeral?
- Thank you.
- Leave.  

If you choose the first one, she will take it kindly and tells you that you are most welcome and that they have much to be thankful for. Inside the Water Queen's House, you will find a scenic landscape and ponds that trail in the middle leading to the fountain. One of the captains reveals that they believe in offering coin to Queen Umberlee to gain blessings during their travels in the sea.

Continue walking down the path and towards the back of the fountain, to the Main Chamber. You will hear a voice praising the Glorious Wavemother and celebrating the passing of one of her daughters. Flood Tide Allandra Grey, the one who's leading the service notices your presence and asks you what tribute you have to honor the Wavemother's fallen daughter. You will get the following options to respond:
- I've brought gold. (500)
- I've brought a prayer.
- I've brought my weapon to help avenge her death.
- Haven't brought any tribute, really.

If you choose the 3rd one, she acknowledges this and tells you that blood must be shed to avenge her. Your tribute is well-received and your next set of choices will look like this:
- Did this person drown?
- Who's the deceased?
- This is one of the more upbeat funerals I've attended.
- Nice corpse. What are we celebrating?

If you choose the first one, she will reply with "Yes, thank the Wavemother." They are praising the Wavemother for sparing her an ignoble death, however, she explains further that it was a beast that took her life. She describes the monster as a rusting pollutant that bleeds black blood, destroying  Umberlee's pristine waters, she said. 
- How did Umberlee 'spare her an ignoble death'?
- I'm good at slaying beasts- maybe I could help you.
- I'm not getting involved in this.

She replies that the queen is generous to those who serve her. She will then ask you to find the master of the beast and slay him, then she will bestow you with one of her most precious gifts. Then you will get the next set of choices:
- Where can I find the beast's master?
- All right- I'll see what I can do.
- Sorry, I don't have time for this.

She will describe how Holli was found by some fishermen. She was last seen swimming in Grey Harbour. She tells you honestly that they haven't found the lair of the beast and were hoping you can find it during its slumber. Agreeing to help them will give you a new quest: Avenge the Drowned. This event will inspire Shadowheart: 'Offerings to the Waves'.

To begin your investigation, one of the things you can do is use Speak with the Dead on the corpse. The corpse known as Holli Daylord will tell you that they were swimming and were attacked in the waters. You will now get the following questions to ask:
- Who are you?
- Do you remember what happened before you were attacked?
- What killed you?
- Where were you attacked?
- Leave.

If you choose the second one, the corpse reveals that they remember black blood surrounding them and described the beast as a Metal Monster. The spell's power wanes, and forbids you from asking any more questions. Now, you will return to Grey Harbour Docks where you just rescued Volo to continue your investigation on Holli's attacker.

Return to the docks where you first found Volo then walk over to a group of people gathered near a boat. Captain Sleam is not allowing any freeloaders and a father will not be able to get on board the boat with his family. You will get the following options:
- Excuse the interruption, Captain, but can I pay for the father's berth? (1000 gp)
- [PERSUASION] Captain... Sleam, is it? It would be a shame to split up the family, don't you think? Let the father go with them.
- [INTIMIDATION] I have news for you, Captain: you're going to accept for the price of three and take the father aboard, or I'll pitch you into the harbor. Got it?
- Leave.

If you choose to do the Persuasion check, you will need to pass a DC of 15. The father named Dharin Brislen will thank you and you can now continue investigating Holli's attacker. Unlock the waypoint at (X:-214 Y:-262 and speak with the fishermen attending to their boat next to it. The man named Gowlan will ask you if you have any experience getting oil out of sealed wood, and you will get the following options to respond:
- Oil? This isn't black blood?
- Have you tried vinegar?
- I'm sure it'll come out eventually.
- Where did all this stuff come from anyway?
- Leave.

If you choose the first one, he will assume that you have been talking to the people from Water Queen's House. Your next set of choices will look like this:
- I'm looking into the death of a waveservant- do you know anything about it?
- Where did all this stuff come from anyway?
- Why are there so many dead fish floating in the harbor?
- Is your boat all right?
- Leave.

If you choose the first one, he will tell you that they were the ones who found her. He goes on to tell you that they tried to help her when they fished her out of the water but she was already dead. Your next set of choices will look like this:
- What happened to her body?
- Did you see anything else unusual?
- Why are there so many dead fish floating in the harbor?
- Is your boat all right?
- Leave.

Then he will tell you that the other waveservants took her body back to the temple. Then he will describe that they saw a sort of wave moving toward the docks when they picked her up even though there weren't any boats around leading them to suspect that it might be something big moving underwater toward Flynn's Cargo, so this is the next area that you will be investigating.

# FLYMM CARGO

You will find Flymm Cargo located south of The Blushing Mermaid. The fastest way to get there is to pass through the lodge and around the docks. Use the stairs to get to the lower levels and reach the level below. After a few sets of stairs, you can now see Flymm's Cargo in the distance. Go to the roof of the building by accessing the balcony at (X:-147 Y:-152), rotate your screen facing the North of your map to see a balcony with a door leading to the inside of the building. Jump down and have one of your characters unlock the door by attempting a Dexterity check, this will require you to pass a DC of 15.

As you head inside, you will find beasts guarding the cargo but no sign of the Metal Beast as described by the waveservants. Luckily, your party is at an advantage because of your positioning which lets you attack the enemies from a safe distance. Eliminate the beasts so you can continue investigating the building. There is a chest below the platform that you are standing on so make sure to check that. Next, you have to reveal a hatch beneath the wooden crates gathered at (X:-161 Y:-140). Move around the crates to reveal the hatch to the basement.

Down in the basement, you will see a door that leads to a larger pathway. Walk to the right of the path and you will see a crack in the wall with the description 'A greasy, smelly climb down...' Take note of this location in the meantime and then return from the path where you came from and interact with the door. Next, you will reach a small room with a 'Subacquatic Dock' door at the end of it. This room reveals a much bigger area and you can now see the water down here.

At the center, you will see Redhammer the Deviser examining something in the water. Walk over to him and then he will tell you that you're not supposed to be down in the basement. Then you will notice the metal contraption in the water and get the following options:
- That submersible- why is it here? What is this place?
- [DECEPTION] Boss sent me to check up on the situation down here.
- [INTIMIDATION] I have questions. You have answers.
- You killed one of those servants of Umberlee. Now they want you dead.
- Sorry, I just got turned around.

If you choose the first one, he will reply that it's the only port that matters in the whole city. Then, he will ask you if Gortash sent you. Your next set of choices will look like this:
- [DECEPTION] Boss sent me to check up on the situation down here.
- [INTIMIDATION] I have questions. You have answers.
- You killed one of those servants of Umberlee. Now they want you dead.
- Sorry, I just got turned around.

If you choose the 3rd one, he will ask if you will make good on that, and tell him that you just want to know what happens in the port to get more information out of him. He will continue to tell you that he uses the port as commanded by Gortash, and he transports whoever he needs to be taken to the Iron Throne. He describes it as an underwater prison and the most secure in the Realms. You will also find out that Gortash keeps Gondians in prison as collateral to keep the Steel Watch Foundry under control.
- I'll make you a deal- take me to the Iron Throne, and I'll protect you from Umberlee's servants.
- You're going to take me to the Iron Throne- I'm getting the prisoners out.
- You're as guilty as the people who imprisoned the Gondians.
- You killed someone. You need to face justice.
- Leave.

If you choose the 3rd one, then you will now begin the battle against Redhammer the Deviser. When you are done fighting him, go to the other end of the hall to find a locked Metal Trunk. The submersible in the water can be used to take you to the Iron Throne, but for now, you must leave this area and return to the path that will take you to the sewers. Later on, you will need to return to Water Queen's House to complete the quest: 'Avenge the Drowned'.

# ABANDONED CISTERN

The entrance to the Sewers from Flymm Cargo is located at (X:-1095 Y:337). Interact with the crack in the wall with the description "A greasy, smelly climb down..." and this will take you directly to a trapped path with locked chests in the area. You can also pick up a map with an X mark on it, but you will need to tread carefully. If you have Astarion with you, switch to turn-based and have him look around to scout for traps and pick the locks on the chests. These chests can be unlocked either by passing a Dexterity or Strength check DC of 20.

When you're done going through the chests, take a dip in the sewer water and follow its flow, but there are enemies waiting for you on the other side so make sure that you are prepared to fight them. Eliminate the enemies perched on the tower and then carefully make your way to the top to surround them. When you're done fighting them, your next task is to solve the Sluice Gate Puzzle.

# HOW TO SOLVE SLUICE VALVE PUZZLE IN ABANDONED CISTERN 

In order to solve this sluice gate puzzle, you will need to balance the heat and the amount of water flowing. There are 2 valves that you can interact with- The Water Valve on the left and the Heat Valve on the Right. This puzzle is dependent on the timing of the valves so do the following:

Interact with the Water Valve on the let
Ready your other character in the other valve and as soon as the Water Valve status teacher the 'Perfect Water' level, interact with the Heat Valve.
If you got the timing correctly, then the Sluice Gate will automatically open.
Take note that if you miss the timing, the valves will cause an explosion that can do fire damage and set the surroundings on fire. You can reset the puzzle by interacting with the valve at the far right, then begin following the solution again. After the fight and solving the puzzle, your next goal is to find Minsc, and before proceeding decide if you will be helping this Human ranger or not.

You will find a door at (X:-164 Y:879), directly in front of you, There's a loose stone that can be detected if you pass the Perception check. Walk towards it and take the Painted Key from it. Behind the pillar, from where you picked up the key, there's a chest that you can interact with. Open it and take the items. You will find more loose stones here if you pass the Persuasion check, during our playthrough, we found at least 3 of them. To the right of the corridor, you can open the door that will take you to the other side of the sewers. However, you would want to go to the other end of that hallway to reach the Undercity Ruins.

You can reach the Undercity Ruins by walking the opposite way from the door you just opened. Make sure to move close to the Waypoint so you can unlock it and then, at the foot of the stairs, you will find a trader by the name of Bareki, a Voiceless Penitent. You can try to communicate with him, but he is sworn to silence. Make sure to take the time to look at his items for sale before you proceed. You will find a Passageway of Penitence behind the trader but go to the left of the NPC, and this other Passageway will take you to the Ancient Lair.

# ANCIENT LAI

When you get to the Ancient Lair, you will be faced with two options: Kill Thrumbo and bring his body back to Philgrave's Mansion, or betray Mystic Carrion which will progress the quest 'Find Mystic Carrion's Servant'. Take note that you will receive two very different outcomes and different rewards.

If you help Thrumbo and betray Mystic Carrion, he will reveal the secret chamber underneath Philgrave's mansion.
If you choose to help Mystic Carrion, you will have to fight Thrumbo and receive the Torch of Revocation reward from Mystic Carrion.
Upon entering, you will dead bodies of humans, and as soon as you loot one of the opened chests, the Undead Foes will get ready to attack you. You can make use of fire spells to effectively fight them off, or use any Radiant spell, as the Undead are vulnerable to these kinds of attacks. This battle will prove to be a long and tedious fight because of their number, so make sure you have healing spells and potions available to you, so you can keep your party alive. 

When you're done fighting your enemies, you can now return to exploring the Ancient Lair. You will discover chests that you can loot gold and valuable items from. Some Gilded and Opulent chests will have traps on them, so be careful as you work on them. Inside the lair, you will see a Stone Wall marking, and you can use any of your abilities to destroy it. Once the wall is down, enter the new area.

This new area is a chamber that contains a book, which reveals that Mystic Carrion's heart is contained in Thrumbo's chest. This will update your quest 'Defeat Mystic Carrion', then, look around you inside the chamber to see a jar that you need to destroy, then head back to speak with Thrumbo, should you decide to help him. You may refer to the Quests page for more info. Your next objective is to return to the Lower City Sewers and continue exploring the other side.

# LOWER CITY SEWERS

Return to the door where you first encountered the Penitent Trader and then proceed to the other end of the hall that will lead you back to Lower City Sewers. There's a big door blocking your path so you can either have Astarion attempt a Dexterity check here or go around the other path to encounter NPCs and discover a ladder that will lead to Szarr Palace, Lady Jannath's Estate, and Lorroakan's Portals.

Continue exploring the depths of the Sewers from this path and you will encounter Aelis Siryasius, who has a profound fear or hate, or both for Absolutists and plans on turning you into kindling for a funeral pyre. You can try and convince him that you're not with the Absolute, then Aelis will continue blabbering about how he and his group were the best thieves in Baldur's Gate and they have stashed their loot in the Sewers where they are currently safe, while the Absolutists search for them. 

However, the rest of his group had joined the cult, as Aelis believes, and he killed them. So now he wants to conduct the funeral rites, for Sarin's final resting place. This will allow Aelis to leave you alone and will not attack you for now. However, if you take him out, you will be able to gain access to his treasure and will solve the Sarin's Skeleton puzzle.

There is a door right next to where you encounter Aelis. Have Astarion lockpick this and attempt a Dexterity check. To pass, he will need a DC of 10. This will reveal a path to the raft in the sewers, and use it to move forward. This will take you to a path closer to the Lord of Murder's domain. As you jump off, switch into turn-based mode as there are traps set here that will explode on contact.

Upon opening the doors, the Night Blades will immediately become hostile as soon as they see your party enter the room. Eliminate all the enemies that you see here and continue exploring the Sewers until you reach a room filled with Noxious Fumes. On the right side of the wall, look for the lever that will dispel the fumes. Continue to work your way on the right side and dispel the traps that you see by attempting Dexterity Checks

Then, jump on the crack on the wall, right on top of the lever that you just deactivated. You will see a breakable wall here and destroy that with Eldritch  Blast or other spellcasting abilities to reveal a ladder out of the Sewers.

# ENTRANCE TO GUILDHALL FROM LOWER CITY SEWERS

Continue exploring the depths of the Sewers and once you reach the Guild Hall at (X:-12 Y:774), you will see a door with the description "No Entry - No Exit". You can attempt a Dexterity check but you will need to pass a DC of 20. This will give you access to the Guildhall Bar. Directly to your right, you will see Lady Ague who will threaten to kill you, should you cross Nine-Fingers. There are other members of the guild gathered here as well as Merchants and other NPCs who offer their services.

In this section, you will find yourself in the middle of an uprising that was started by the Zhentarim Leader, Roah, and the Guildhall Leader Nine-Fingers Keene. If you choose to side with Keene, you need to inform Roah about your decision, but this will make all of the Zhentarim hostile, and the Guildhall will be on your side. Then, Keene will be grateful for your help, and they will offer to aid you in your fight against the Absolute later on. Otherwise, if you agree to take Zhentarim's side, the fight against the members of the Guildhall will begin and then Roah will become the new leader of the Guildhall and will reward you for your help by joining you in the fight against the Absolute later on.

Continue exploring the Guildhall and you will meet a man named 'The Professor' who will ask which crew you are affiliated with. You will have the following options to respond:
- [DECEPTION] Neither. I run a crew called the Wormskulls.
- Consider me an independent operator.
- I'm not with any crew. Why?
- Leave.

Choose the 2nd one so the Professor will leave you alone. He will also warn you to not get involved with Zhentarim. Then you can continue to look around and interact with the other NPCs. Follow the guide in your mini-map and interact with the door to meet Nine-Fingers Keene, who is in the middle of a discussion with Uktar who is trying to persuade her to withdraw protection from those who failed to pay tribute but Nine-Fingers is firm with her decision and welcomes you into the room as soon as they notice you.

Nine-Fingers Keene will tell you that she plans on burning the Absolute from the city, and if you want to help, she will welcome it. Now, you will get the following options to respond:
- What can I do to help you?
- Why do I need to help the Guild? I've been doing well enough without you so far.
- You can help a companion of mine who needs information- Jaheira.
- I need information.
- I ran into some of your thugs- the Rivington Rats?
- Leave.

If you mention Jaheira by choosing the 3rd option, she will start asking questions about your purpose and your identity. Then, you will get the following options to respond:
- Well, you already know I'm a friend of Jaheira's.
- A passer-by. I heard you serve good food down here.
- Just exploring the local sewer life.
- Let Jaheira do the talking.

If you choose the first one, Jaheira will give you her approval. Then, she will ask Keene about a man named Minsc. Keene will respond that they're about to bring him in, but can't promise anything about his condition. Keene believes that Minsc has found a new name and believes that he is none other than Stone Lord who has been stealing her own territory for his own cult. She claims that she knows where the next attack is going to take place and plans on attacking there.

Jaheira will try to convince Nine-Fingers to call off the ambush and let your party handle it. If you support Jaheira and respond to Nine-Fingers by saying 'She's not alone- she has me.', Jaheira will give you her approval. However, Nine-Fingers is very stubborn and will not call off the ambush, so instead, you can look around in the Guildhall to search for leads. This will also update The High Harper quest.

# RETURN TO THE SURFACE, LOWER CITY

As soon as you're done with getting intel, you can return to the surface and complete the quest in Water Queen's House. If you offered to help the Wave Servant, which meant that you would fight Redhammer the Deviser, then make use of the Waypoint in the docks, then walk to the Water Queen's House to complete the Avenge The Drowned. Make your way to the back of the building where the Waveservants are gathered. They will ask you if it's done, and if you killed Redhammer, then you tell them that the beastmaster is dead.

Flood Tide Allandra Grey will thank you for your service and she will reward you with the Wavemother's Robe, a very rare clothing that provides Watery Rejuvenation and Temperature adjustment. Make sure to check out the Armour page for more info.

# THE COUNTING HOUSE

Following the events that took place after Jaheir and Nine-Fingers Keene's meeting, you will now continue to look for Minsc. Your next destination is The Counting House, where you will solve the Vault Puzzle and meet Minsc for the first time. You will find this building on the Southern side of the Lower City at exactly (X:-98 Y:-148).

As soon as you enter the building, you will find yourself in a Grand Hall, fitted with a tall ceiling and bright fixtures. Speak with the Head Clerk Meadhoney at the front desk who seems to be worried about something.  You will get the following options to respond:

Remind me again where Head Banker Glitterbeard is?
- Who is this Stone Lord that has you worried?
- I'm not a customer. I'm here because Nine-Fingers is planning something in your vault.
- I need access to your vaults.
- I would like to open an account.
- Leave.

Choose the second option that will prompt Meadhoney to reveal that a man named Stone Lord has taken the Head Banker below. He didn't say where specifically so you'll get the next options to respond:
- [PERSUASION] Let me help. I'll go and check on your Head Banker.
- Tell me more about this large fellow.
- It sounds like a robbery to me.
- I want to open an account.
- Leave.

If you choose to attempt the Persuasion check, you will need to pass a DC of 18. If you succeed, the Head Clerk will say that it is unusual but will agree nevertheless. He will hand you a temporary vault pass that will give access to the lower part of The Counting House. Interact with the Iron Fence next to the Head Clerk's table, then a guard will approach asking for your pass. Hand it over, and then the gate will be opened to your party.

There are locked chests here that you can lockpick to loot their gold and some others that are already opened. Take a look around here to get valuable items including gold. Then, interact with The Double Door at the end of the hall where you will see guards stationed at the gate. Before you can go, they will ask you again for your pass. So show it, and then you will be allowed access. Continue following the stairs that will lead to The Vault Door.

# SOLVE THE VAULT PUZZLE IN THE COUNTING HOUSE

To solve the puzzle in The Counting House, you will need to step on the correct tile in the right order. Doing this will light up the indicators on top of the Vault Door. To do this, you need to ungroup your party first and then move them to the correct tile without stepping on another tile.

You can do this with just one character, or have your entire party stand on each plate. So as you are facing the light indicator step on the following tiles:
- Top Left Corner Tile
- Top Right Corner Tile
- Center Tile
- Middle Row, Right Tile

If you do the puzzle correctly, the Vault Door will be opened automatically. Then, follow the stairs going down. As soon as you reach the door, a cutscene will play showing Minsc and the Bhaal Cultists. Minsc was kept inside a mimic, a monster chest but he would break free from the inside. Then, a clone Jaheira will show herself and claim to be working with The Absolute. She claims that Nine-Fingers Keene set a poor trap for Minsc, and she will ask the Stone Lord to leave, and then they will retreat to the Sewers.

You will be left to fight with the remaining Bhaal Cultists here if you don't have Jaheira in your party.  You are now free to speak with the Head Banker who was caught in the middle of this trap. He will ask for your help to get the coin that was stolen from The Counting House. He will invite you to look around and investigate the area, then he will leave. 

# LOWER CITY SEWERS

As Minsc believes that he is working with the real Jaheira, he has retreated into the dark with the clone. You will now follow their trace into the Lower City Sewers. You can make use of the Waypoint and travel to the Undercity Ruins, which is the closest one to the Lower City Sewers. Make your way back to The Sluice Gate to reach Minsc and Clone Jaheira's hiding place.

Go through the pipes and a cutscene will play where Roah Moonglow and Minsc are seen talking. They are talking about their plans and that they serve only The Absolute. Roah speaks about returning to The Guildhall to do their bidding. However, Minsc will spot your party from a distance. Roah will try to run away and the battle against Minsc and his party will begin.  Attack the fake Jaheira first, and then knock out Minsc.

NOTE: If you want to keep Minsc alive, make sure to switch to a non-lethal attack. This will result in Minsc getting knocked out.

Then, using your Illithid powers, you can see the image of Jaheira in Minsc's mind. He thinks that you have killed the real one, but you can counter this with your thoughts. Minsc will continue to run away deeper into the Sewers. Follow his lead as he destroys the crumbling wall. This will take you to a small room where Minsc warns you to not show fear and to trust in him. Then, you will get the following choices:
- I do trust you. I think.
- If this is a trap, you die first.
- Can we just get on with... whatever this is?
- Minsc will fall to his knees and appear to speak to a tiny creature. He will introduce you to Boo, a hamster. He calls it a Miniature Giant Space Hamster, and that you will be able to learn the difference in time. Minsc and Boo will join your party, and cleanse Baldur's Gate of Evil together. Invite Minsc to your camp if you have a full party, and he will give you his approval. This will also complete The High Harper quest.

# GUILDHALL

Return to the Guildhall once more by traveling to the Revealed Entrace at Lower City (X:57 Y:-96),  to settle the matter with Nine-Fingers Keene. At the entrance, you will find Roah Moonglow who has something to tell you after she escaped the Sewers last time. She offers her, and the Zhentarim's alliance with you to purge the Guildhall of Nine-Fingers Keene's loyal servants. She will try to convince you that Keene's guild is undisciplined and broken, but Roah's is still strong.

NOTE: If you choose to side with Keene, then you will have to fight Roah and the Zhentarim. Then, Keene will be grateful for your help, and they will offer to aid you in your fight against the Absolute later on. Otherwise, if you agree to take Zhentarim's side, the fight against the members of the Guildhall will begin and then Roah will become the new leader of the Guildhall and will reward you for your help by joining you in the fight against the Absolute later on.

Settling this matter will result in a bloody Guildhall, and you will be left to loot the bodies of the Zhentarim. Next, seek out the bloodied Keene who's seated at her desk. She will now offer to help you in the fight against the Absolute. You can also ask her about how she knew Jaheira and what happened to her Guild. The Aid the Underduke quest will also be completed upon defeating the Zhentarim.

After that, you can now return to The Counting House and return the gold that was stolen. This will complete Return Rakath's Gold, and you will be rewarded handsomely, together with a Counting House Vault 9 Key. You will find this Vault inside the large vault on the walls. You will get Elegant Studded Leather, a very rare light amour.

# RETURN TO THE STREETS OF LOWER CITY

Now that you were able to settle the uprising in the Guildhall, you will now return to the street of Lower City where you will continue your quest related to Mystic Carrion and his servant. Move to (X:-10 Y:-158) and you'll discover a hidden stone wall. Have Astarion unlock this door by attempting a Dexterity Check, but you will need to pass a DC of 25. This will take you to Philgrave's Mansion.

A mummy Mystic Carrion will see you right away, and he tells you that you do not have an appointment. He recognizes that you are familiar with the Necromancy of Thay. He will ask you about your thoughts of its contents. You will get two options to respond:

You're familiar with the subject matter?
Oh yes, I loved it. Especially the part about the unicorns.
If you choose the first one, he will suspect that you are not familiar with it and will try to turn you away and will suggest that you return to the domain of the living. You will get the next choices:

Is there anything I can do for you?
Have you anything to trade?
Leave.

If you choose the first one, Mystic Carrion will consider getting your help for a task. He tells you about his servant by the name of Thrumbo who ran away. He is asking you to return the body to him, and you will be rewarded. Then, you will get the following options to respond:
- First, tell me why he ran.
- His body? It sounds like you want him killed.
- Baldur's Gate is a big city/ A name's not much to go on.
- i might be able to help. For a fee, of course.
- I'll think about it.
- You've got a deal.

If you choose the 3rd one, Mystic Carrion will tell you that he has accopmplices, and has led many others astray. If you agree to help Mystic Carrion, he tells you that spirits bore witness to the agreement, and they will follow your progress too, just like him. You will have a new quest "Find Mystic Carrion's Servant." Before leaving this room, make sure to trade with him and take a look at his very rare items for sell that might be suitable for yourself, or your companions. 

Due to the lack of information from Mystic Carrion, you will go around searching the docks and looking for anything related to Thrumbo and his servants. You will find a Strange Beggar Lumbar on the streets of the Lower City at (X:124 Y:-30), just outside the mansion. As soon as you mention the name Carrion to him, he will become hostile. You will get the following options to respond:
- [DECEPTION] Carrion means Thrumbo no harm. He sent me with provisions for his journey.
- [INTIMIDATION] Either you tell me where Thrumbo is, or I drive my fist through your skull.
- [PERSUASION] Tell me where Thrumbo is, and it'll be like we never met.
- Leave.

If you choose the first one, you will need to pass a DC of 18. Lumbar tells you that he last heard from Thrumbo that he's going to get them a boat, but haven't heard from him since and he suspects that he must be somewhere near the water.

You will be able to locate Thrumbo inside Vonayn's Home near the shore in the Lower City. It's close to where Philgrave's Mansion is, and if you have explored this area before, this is where you fought Sea Monsters or Sahuagin enemies that jumped out of the water to attack you. If it's your first time, it will be an interesting encounter. Then, go inside the house next to the pier, use the stairs and you will find Thrumbo hiding in the wardrobe to your right.

NOTE: You can either choose to help Thrumbo or Mystic Carrion. This will reap you two different rewards and  2 different outcomes for this quest as well. However, you will be able to loot more from Mystic Carrion if you kill him, and you can take the Torch of Revocation from the chest inside Mystic Carrion's room if you kill him.

If you help Thrumbo, this will involve destroying the parts of Mystic Carrion that keep him alive. You will have to travel to the sewers, in the Undercity Ruins and smash the jars containing Mystic Carrion's brain, and liver. Then, you will discover that Mystic Carrion's heart is inside Thrumbo, and he will have to vomit it so you can destroy it. Then, you must return to Philgrave Mansion and kill Mystic Carrion to get the Crypt Lord Ring from Thrumbo.
If you choose to help Mystic Carrion, all you have to do is take Mystic Carrion's heart from Thrumbo and bring it back to Philgrave's Mansion. He will reward you with Torch of Revocation.
