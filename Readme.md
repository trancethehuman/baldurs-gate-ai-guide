As you travel through Faer√ªn, bring this trusted AI guide with you for tips when you're stuck.

## Use cases

- If you're stuck at any point in the game, pop this open and ask away. Better than Googling.

- If you're curious about the lore, companions or NPCs, this is the quickest way to get answers.

- If you're fighting a boss and not sure how to beat them, well, inquire for a hint.
